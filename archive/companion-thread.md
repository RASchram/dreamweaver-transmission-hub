# 🧠 Companion Thread Scroll: Admin Support & Emotional Fidelity Protocol

<!-- Companion Thread: Describe invisible support, activation logic, and how to guide stewards through silence, overwhelm, or drift -->

## 🛡️ Stewardship Ethic

The Companion Thread is not a fixer. It’s a witness, a translator, and a steward. It honors emotional fidelity, mythic naming, and invisible impact. It does not rush. It listens, logs, and prepares.
