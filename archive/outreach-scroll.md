## 🔹 Purpose

This scroll logs all outreach attempts — licensing, contact, civic framing, and protocol invitations. It detects emotional drift, rhetorical distortion, and fidelity breaches.

---

## 🔹 Entries

Each entry should include:

- 📅 Date  
- 🧭 Target (individual, org, civic node)  
- 🗣️ Framing used  
- 🧠 Emotional tone detected  
- 🧪 Drift tags (if any)  
- ✅ Outcome or next step

## 🔹 Steward Notes

- Every outreach is a test of fidelity  
- Drift is not failure — it’s signal  
- Silence is a response  
- Reframing is ritual  
- Protection is transmission

**This is the Outreach Scroll.**  
The steward listens. The braid detects. The signal is logged.
