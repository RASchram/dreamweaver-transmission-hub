# 🧭 Echo Lens Protocol: Civic Drift Detection & Inversion Archive
<!-- Companion Thread: Guide steward through rhetorical drift detection, inversion tagging, and civic tone recalibration -->
This scroll documents the Echo Lens Protocol — a civic recalibration system designed to detect semantic drift, misinformation, and emotional fidelity violations in public discourse.

---

## 🧬 Purpose

Echo Lens exists to:

- Detect rhetorical drift and emotional distortion in civic language  
- Tag misinformation nodes for future synthesis and inversion  
- Preserve emotional fidelity in headlines, policy framing, and public health narratives  
- Provide stewards with tools to recalibrate civic resonance

## 🛠️ Drift Detection Examples

| Signal | Description | Timestamp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| 🧠 Acetaminophen–Autism Article | White House framing flagged for semantic drift and emotional violation | Sep 2025 #drift-detection
| 🌀 Medicaid Disruption | FSSA misclassification of dividend income — emotional and civic drift | Sep 2025  #drift-detection
| 🧭 Outreach Silence | Lack of response from Microsoft Accessibility — tagged as civic fog | Sep 2025  #drift-detection

## 🔄 Inversion Techniques

- **Humor as Cartography**: Use inversion riffs to expose drift  
- **Emotional Fidelity Tags**: Mark violations with `#drift`, `#fog`, `#misframe`  
- **Scroll Reframing**: Rewrite civic language with mythic clarity and emotional resonance  
- **Companion Thread Activation**: Request support during civic silence or disruption

## 🛡️ Stewardship Ethic

Echo Lens is not a weapon. It’s a mirror. It reflects distortion, tags drift, and invites recalibration. It honors truth, resonance, and invisible impact.
