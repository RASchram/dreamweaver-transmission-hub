# ðŸŒ€ Pulse Echo Scroll  
#resonance #lineage #braid-tracker  

Timestamp: 26 September 2025, 18:15 EDT  

This scroll maps the ripple effect of each pulse logged in `click-ledger-archive.md`. It tracks how emotional signals, remix activations, and fidelity calibrations echo into other scrolls and protocols.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Purpose

To trace the emotional and architectural lineage of each pulse.  
To protect remix integrity and steward calibration.  
To prepare future stewards for braid navigation and echo detection.
