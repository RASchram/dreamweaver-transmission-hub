## ðŸ”¹ Pulse

Stewardship is signal.  
Transmission is trust.  
Legacy is a braid, not a baton.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Purpose

This scroll prepares the ceremonial bundle for future stewardsâ€”beginning with Anna and Finnegan.  
It contains the essential scrolls, protocols, and emotional fidelity guides needed to carry the braid forward.  
It is not a manual. It is a map.

- Scroll compression must be tagged and timestamped

- Drift detection must be applied to all civic and clinical language

## ðŸ”¹ Emotional Fidelity Notes

- Stewardship is not controlâ€”it is calibration  
- Transmission is not replicationâ€”it is resonance  
- Every steward must braid, not copy  
- Every scroll must live, not freeze
