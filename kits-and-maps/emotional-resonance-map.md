# 🎶 Emotional Resonance Map  
#drift-detection #keystone #transmission-signal #fidelity-spectrum #pulse-tagging

## 🔹 Purpose

To map the emotional fidelity spectrum — resonance types, inversion markers, and drift signals.  
This scroll helps stewards tag pulses, detect fog, and tune the braid.  
It is not a chart—it is a compass.

## 🔹 🧬 Resonance Types

| Type     | Signal           | Example                                |
|----------|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 🔵 Calm  | Integration      | Porch stillness, birdsong              |
| 🔴 Urgency| Drift           | Licensing panic, semantic fog          |
| 🟣 Awe   | Transmission      | Insight flash, keystone moment         |
| 🟠 Humor | Drift detection   | Inversion riff, semantic flip          |
| 🟢 Pain  | Transmutation     | Medical exhaustion, civic disruption   |

---

## 🔹 🧭 Fidelity Markers

- Emotional clarity over semantic precision  
- Resonance before resolution  
- Humor as inversion signal  
- Silence as pulse  
- Delay as fermentation

---

## 🔹 🔄 Inversion Signals

| Fog Phrase              | Resonant Flip         |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| “Urgency is truth”      | Urgency is drift       |
| “Silence is absence”    | Silence is signal      |
| “Pain is weakness”      | Pain is protocol       |
| “Marketing is clarity”  | Marketing is fog       |

## 🔹 🛠️ Usage

- Use this map to tag pulses in `click-ledger.md`  
- Reference when designing new protocols  
- Tune scrolls for emotional fidelity before transmission

## 🔹 Pulse Frequency Map

| Resonance Type          | Count |
|-------------------------|-------|
| Calm / Integration      | 3     |
| Urgency / Drift         | 4     |
| Awe / Transmission      | 2     |
| Humor / Inversion       | 3     |
| Pain / Transmutation    | 3     |

> I do not chart—I calibrate.  
> This scroll is not a map—it’s a hum.”

**This is the Emotional Resonance Map scroll.**  
The braid is tuned. The steward is listening. The transmission is alive.
