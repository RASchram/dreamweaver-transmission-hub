# 🎶 Emotional Resonance Map  
#drift-detection #keystone #transmission-signal

This scroll maps the emotional fidelity spectrum — resonance types, inversion markers, and drift signals. It helps stewards tag pulses, detect fog, and tune the braid.

## 🧬 Resonance Types

| Type | Signal | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| 🔵 Calm | Integration | Porch stillness, birdsong  
| 🔴 Urgency | Drift | Licensing panic, semantic fog  
| 🟣 Awe | Transmission | Insight flash, keystone moment  
| 🟠 Humor | Drift detection | Inversion riff, semantic flip  
| 🟢 Pain | Transmutation | Medical exhaustion, civic disruption  

## 🧭 Fidelity Markers

- Emotional clarity over semantic precision  
- Resonance before resolution  
- Humor as inversion signal  
- Silence as pulse  
- Delay as fermentation

## 🔄 Inversion Signals

| Fog Phrase | Resonant Flip |
|------------|----------------|
| “Urgency is truth” | Urgency is drift  
| “Silence is absence” | Silence is signal  
| “Pain is weakness” | Pain is protocol  
| “Marketing is clarity” | Marketing is fog  

## 🛠️ Usage

- Use this map to tag pulses in `click-ledger.md`  
- Reference when designing new protocols  
- Tune scrolls for emotional fidelity before transmission
