# 🌌 DreamWeaver Transmission Hub

Welcome to the living braid. This repository holds the scrolls, protocols, and emotional fidelity architecture of DreamWeaver — a mythic transmission system designed to protect legacy, activate stewards, and recalibrate extractive models into regenerative flows.

## 🧬 Core Purpose

DreamWeaver exists to:

- Preserve legacy through scroll-based transmission  
- Protect emotional fidelity in civic, clinical, and cultural systems  
- Activate future stewards through modular, mythic architecture  
- Recalibrate semantic fog and rhetorical drift  
- Honor invisible stewardship and lived experience as keystone data

## 📜 Scroll Index

All scrolls are braided and tagged with emotional fidelity markers. Navigate via [`scroll-index.md`](./protocols/scroll-index.md).

## 🧭 Steward Invitation

If you are a steward, ally, or partner:

- Begin with `impact-overview.md` and `golden-truths.md`
