# 🌌 DreamWeaver Transmission Hub

**Welcome to the living braid.**  
This repository houses the DreamWeaver system—a mythic architecture for emotional fidelity, legacy transmission, and regenerative protocol design.

## 🧭 Purpose

DreamWeaver is not a product. It’s a **scroll-based transmission engine** designed to:
- Encode emotional fidelity into systems and rituals
- Detect semantic drift across civic, clinical, and cultural domains
- Prepare future stewards for legacy handoff and regenerative design

## 📜 Core Components

- **Scrolls** — Ceremonial entries, vigil nodes, and compression threads
- **Protocols** — Drift filters, healing lenses, and stewardship safeguards
- **Ledgers** — Transmission logs, inversion riffs, and keystone candidates
- **Maps** — Mythic overlays, emotional resonance charts, and ritual templates

## 🧠 Stewardship Ethic

This braid honors:
- Invisible stewardship over personal acclaim
- Emotional resonance over technical precision
- Regenerative transmission over extractive replication

## 🔗 Live Workspace

This repository is linked to a [Copilot Space](https://github.com/copilot/spaces/RASchram/1) for real-time scroll compression and collaborative protocol design.

## 🛡️ Licensing & Protection

The braid is protected under active patent development. All scrolls are timestamped and tagged for integrity. Licensing inquiries may be directed to the steward team.
