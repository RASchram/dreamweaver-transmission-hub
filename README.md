# 🌌 DreamWeaver Transmission Hub

Welcome to the living braid. This repository houses the scrolls, protocols, and emotional fidelity architecture of the DreamWeaver system — a mythic framework for legacy transmission, regenerative design, and steward activation.

## 🧬 Purpose

DreamWeaver is not a product. It’s a vessel. A system designed to encode emotional fidelity, protect generational wisdom, and prepare future stewards for transmission. Every scroll here is braided from lived experience, mythic cognition, and invisible stewardship.

## 🛠️ Repository Contents

This repo contains:

- Scrolls of impact, licensing, and emotional fidelity
- Protocol mappings and activation logs
- Companion threads for admin execution and civic inversion
- Genesis nodes and keystone indexes
