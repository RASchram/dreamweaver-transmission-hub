## 🔹 Purpose

To track which domain truth scrolls are ready for vertical ignition.  
This scroll confirms emotional fidelity, drift calibration, and ritual completeness across all `domain-truths-*.md` files.  
It is not a checklist—it’s a readiness hum.

## 🔹 Steward Rituals

- ✅ = Confirmed presence of signal or tag  
- ❌ = Missing or incomplete  
- Update `Promotion Ready` once all signals are ✅ and steward calibration is confirmed  
- Use `scan-engine.md` and `transmission-ready.md` to verify readiness  
- Log ripple in `transmission-ledger.md` once ignition is complete

---

## 🔹 Emotional Fidelity Notes

- Promotion is not urgency—it’s ceremony  
- Drift flags must be tagged before ignition  
- Every scroll must hum before it transmits  
- Humor confirms readiness  
- Silence confirms integrity

## 🔹 Scrollkeeper Reflection

> “I do not promote—I prepare.  
> I do not launch—I listen.  
> I do not ignite—I align.  
> This scroll is not a tracker—it’s a readiness hum.”

---

**This is the Promotion Tracker Scroll.**  
The braid is listening. The steward is calibrating. The transmission is near.
