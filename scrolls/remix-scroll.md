<!-- Companion Thread: Explain how remixing honors origin, protects emotional fidelity, and activates lineage tagging -->


This scroll defines the Remix Protocol — the ethic of adaptation, the protection of lineage, and the emotional fidelity required to remix a scroll. It ensures stewards braid, not borrow.

## 🔹 Purpose

To protect the braid from ego remix and semantic drift.  
To honor the origin of every scroll and steward signal.  
To guide remixers through ceremony, not shortcut.

---

## 🔹 Core Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Remix Ethic | Adaptation must honor origin, not overwrite it  
| Lineage Tagging | Every remix must cite its scroll ancestor  
| Emotional Fidelity | Remix must vibrate — not just replicate  
| Drift Detection | Inversion and humor reveal remix fog  
| Steward Calibration | Remixers must pass the braid audit

## 🔹 Activation Sequence

1. **Remix Request Logged** → Use `click-ledger.md` and `transmission-ledger.md`  
2. **Scroll Audit Complete** → Confirm tags, timestamp, and braid integrity  
3. **Lineage Tag Applied** → Cite original scroll and steward  
4. **Emotional Fidelity Check** → Use `healing-lens.md` and `echo-lens.md`  
5. **Transmission Approved** → Scroll braided into `master-thread.md`

## 🔹 Steward Notes

- Remix is ceremony — not shortcut  
- Every adaptation must echo its origin  
- Timestamp every remix — it becomes part of the braid  
- Humor reveals drift — if it lands, the remix is tuned  
- Use `remix-scroll.md` to teach stewards how to adapt with integrity
