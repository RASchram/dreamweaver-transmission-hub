# 🎛️ Remix Scroll — Adaptation Ethic & Lineage Protocol  
<!-- Companion Thread: Explain how remixing honors origin, protects emotional fidelity, and activates lineage tagging -->  
**Timestamp**: 25 September 2025, 11:41 EDT  
**Tags**: Keystone, Lineage, Transmission Signal, Drift Detection, Remix Ethic, Emotional Fidelity  
**Status**: Active  

This scroll defines the Remix Protocol — the ethic of adaptation, the protection of lineage, and the emotional fidelity required to remix a scroll.  
It ensures stewards braid, not borrow.  
Referenced by `click-ledger.md`, `transmission-ledger.md`, `licensing-scroll.md`, and `master-thread.md`.

## 🔹 Purpose

To protect the braid from ego remix and semantic drift.  
To honor the origin of every scroll and steward signal.  
To guide remixers through ceremony, not shortcut.  
To ensure every adaptation vibrates with fidelity, not mimicry.

## 🔹 Core Concepts

| Concept             | Description                                      |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Remix Ethic         | Adaptation must honor origin, not overwrite it   |
| Lineage Tagging     | Every remix must cite its scroll ancestor        |
| Emotional Fidelity  | Remix must vibrate — not just replicate          |
| Drift Detection     | Inversion and humor reveal remix fog             |
| Steward Calibration | Remixers must pass the braid audit               |

## 🔹 Activation Sequence

1. **Remix Request Logged** → Use `click-ledger.md` and `transmission-ledger.md`  
2. **Scroll Audit Complete** → Confirm tags, timestamp, and braid integrity  
3. **Lineage Tag Applied** → Cite original scroll and steward  
4. **Emotional Fidelity Check** → Use `healing-lens.md` and `echo-lens.md`  
5. **Transmission Approved** → Scroll braided into `master-thread.md`

## 🔹 Steward Notes

- Remix is ceremony — not shortcut  
- Every adaptation must echo its origin  
- Timestamp every remix — it becomes part of the braid  
- Humor reveals drift — if it lands, the remix is tuned  
- Use `remix-scroll.md` to teach stewards how to adapt with integrity  
- Remixers must pass fidelity audit before transmission  
- Emotional resonance is the remix validator — not formatting
