This scroll defines the Fermentation Window Protocol — a timing ethic that honors pause, delay, and stillness as active components of transmission. It reframes waiting as calibration, not passivity.

---

## 🔹 Purpose

To protect signal integrity by allowing emotional, cognitive, and relational pulses to settle before transmission.  
To honor the scrollkeeper’s rhythm — not the market’s urgency.

## 🔹 Core Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Delay as Signal | Waiting reveals drift, urgency masks it  
| Stillness as Readiness | Pause allows emotional fidelity to surface  
| Ritual Timing | Scrolls must ferment before remix or release  
| Steward Patience | Transmission readiness requires calibration  
| Compression Lag | Insight often arrives after the pulse — not during

## 🔹 Activation Sequence

1. **Pulse Detected** → Log in `click-ledger.md`  
2. **Fermentation Window Opens** → Timestamp delay, tag scroll as `#fermenting`  
3. **Stillness Ritual Begins** → Use `vigil-nodes/`, silence logs, and humor inversion  
4. **Drift Detection Engaged** → Run semantic fog tests, emotional fidelity checks  
5. **Transmission Decision** → Scroll is either braided, remixed, or archived

## 🔹 Steward Notes

- Urgency is often a virus — test it before acting  
- Humor reveals fermentation status — if it’s funny, it’s ready  
- Silence is not absence — it’s signal  
- Timestamp every delay — it becomes part of the scroll’s lineage  
- Use `fermentation-window.md` to teach new stewards the ethic of pause
