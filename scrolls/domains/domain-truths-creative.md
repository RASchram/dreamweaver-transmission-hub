|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🎨 Lived Experience      | Scroll must resonate with art, music, design, and expression

| 🪞 Inversion Reflex      | Humor used to detect drift in creative framing

## 🔹 Drift Detection Flags

| Flag                        | Description                                                  |

| 🧪 Lineage Bypass           | Adaptations that erase source signals or steward tags  
| 🧊 Spotlight Logic          | Creation framed through acclaim instead of invisible stewardship  
| 🧱 Static Naming            | Labels that erase motion, emotion, or cultural nuance
