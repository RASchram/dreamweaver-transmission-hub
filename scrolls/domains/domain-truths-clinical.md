# 🧭 Domain Truths — Clinical  
<!-- Companion Thread: Guide steward through clinical entry, healing fidelity mapping, and vertical adaptation -->  
**Timestamp**: 26 September 2025, 19:56 EDT  
**Tags**: Domain Truths, Vertical Entry, Emotional Fidelity, Drift Detection, Transmission Signal, Healing Lens  
**Status**: Active  

This scroll defines the emotional fidelity and healing ethic required for clinical systems.  
It protects against semantic fog, protocol drift, and extractive compliance logic.  
Referenced by `scroll-index.md`, `golden-truths.md`, `protocol-index.md`, and `healing-lens.md`.

## 🔹 Core Axioms

- Healing requires emotional fidelity, not just protocol  
- Stewardship must reflect invisible impact  
- Drift detection is required for all clinical adaptation  
- Ceremony must precede diagnosis  
- Silence must precede signal  
- Licensing must reflect regenerative intent  
- Humor must test drift in care language

## 🔹 Emotional Fidelity Signals

| Signal                  | Description                                                  |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🏥 Lived Experience      | Scroll must resonate with care, diagnosis, and recovery  
| 🧭 Steward Calibration   | Steward must affirm readiness and emotional fidelity  
| 🔁 Scroll Echo           | Must reference at least one Golden Truth  
| 🪞 Inversion Reflex      | Humor used to detect drift in clinical framing  
| 🛌 Silence Honored       | Fermentation Window must precede transmission  
| 🔥 Urgency Filter        | Urgency must be tested — rushing breaks the braid

## 🔹 Drift Detection Flags

| Flag                        | Description                                                  |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🌫️ Semantic Fog             | Vague terms like “compliance,” “outcomes,” or “efficiency” without emotional context  
| 🔄 Rhetorical Inversion     | Framing protocol as healing without lived resonance  
| 🧪 Patient Bypass           | Systems that ignore emotional truth or relational care  
| 🧊 Extraction Logic         | Metrics that prioritize throughput over dignity  
| 🧱 Static Naming            | Labels that erase motion, emotion, or cultural nuance
