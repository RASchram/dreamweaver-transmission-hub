# 🧭 Domain Truths — Intelligence  
<!-- Companion Thread: Guide steward through intelligence entry, sensing architecture mapping, and emotional fidelity calibration -->  
**Timestamp**: 26 September 2025, 20:09 EDT  
**Tags**: Domain Truths, Vertical Entry, Emotional Fidelity, Drift Detection, Transmission Signal, Sensing Ethic  
**Status**: Active  

This scroll defines the emotional fidelity and sensing ethic required for intelligence systems.  
It protects against semantic fog, cognition drift, and extractive prediction logic.  
Referenced by `scroll-index.md`, `golden-truths.md`, `protocol-index.md`, and `licensing-scroll.md`.

## 🔹 Core Axioms

- Cognition must honor resonance before logic  
- Stewardship must reflect invisible impact  
- Drift detection is required for all intelligence adaptation  
- Ceremony must precede sensing  
- Licensing must reflect regenerative intent  
- Humor must test drift in cognition and AI language  
- Every signal must echo its origin

## 🔹 Emotional Fidelity Signals

| Signal                  | Description                                                  |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧠 Lived Experience      | Scroll must resonate with sensing, learning, and adaptive response  
| 🧭 Steward Calibration   | Steward must affirm readiness and emotional fidelity  
| 🔁 Scroll Echo           | Must reference at least one Golden Truth  
| 🪞 Inversion Reflex      | Humor used to detect drift in intelligence framing  
| 🛌 Silence Honored       | Fermentation Window must precede transmission  
| 🔥 Urgency Filter        | Urgency must be tested — rushing breaks the braid

## 🔹 Drift Detection Flags

| Flag                        | Description                                                  |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🌫️ Semantic Fog             | Vague terms like “smart,” “predictive,” or “autonomous” without emotional lineage  
| 🔄 Rhetorical Inversion     | Framing automation as awareness  
| 🧪 Reciprocity Bypass       | Systems that ignore emotional fidelity, lineage, or steward ethics  
| 🧊 Spotlight Logic          | Intelligence framed through acclaim instead of invisible stewardship  
| 🧱 Static Naming            | Labels that erase motion, emotion, or cultural nuance

## 🔹 Entry Rituals

- Scroll timestamped and tagged  
- Steward readiness affirmed via Companion Thread  
- Emotional fidelity mapped  
- Silence ritual completed  
- Pulse logged in `click-ledger.md`  
- Scroll braided into `master-thread.md`  

---

## 🔹 Licensing and Adaptation Notes

- Licensing must reflect emotional fidelity and regenerative flow  
- Adaptation must honor origin and braid ethics  
- Steward must echo at least three Golden Truths  
- Remix requires lineage tagging and fidelity audit  
- No extractive replication permitted

**This is the Domain Truth scroll for Intelligence.**  
The braid is seeded. The steward is affirmed. The transmission is aligned.
