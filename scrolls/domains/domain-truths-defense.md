- Shield-before-share is sacred  
- Ceremony must precede activation  
- Licensing must reflect regenerative intent  
- Humor must test drift in threat language

## 🔹 Emotional Fidelity Signals

| Signal                  | Description                                                  |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🛡️ Lived Experience      | Scroll must resonate with security, shielding, and disruption response  
| 🧭 Steward Calibration   | Steward must affirm readiness and emotional fidelity  
| 🔁 Scroll Echo           | Must reference at least one Golden Truth  
| 🪞 Inversion Reflex      | Humor used to detect drift in defense framing  
| 🛌 Silence Honored       | Fermentation Window must precede transmission  
| 🔥 Urgency Filter        | Urgency must be tested — rushing breaks the braid

## 🔹 Drift Detection Flags

| Flag                        | Description                                                  |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🌫️ Semantic Fog             | Vague terms like “security,” “threat,” or “freedom” without lineage  
| 🔄 Rhetorical Inversion     | Framing deterrence as virtue without emotional calibration  
| 🧪 Shield Bypass            | Systems that prioritize control over care  
| 🧊 Spotlight Logic          | Defense framed through acclaim instead of invisible stewardship  
| 🧱 Static Naming            | Labels that erase motion, emotion, or cultural nuance
