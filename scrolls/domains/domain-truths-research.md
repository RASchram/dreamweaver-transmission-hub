# 🧭 Domain Truths — Research  
<!-- Companion Thread: Guide steward through research entry, inquiry ethics mapping, and emotional fidelity calibration -->  
**Timestamp**: 27 September 2025, 10:09 EDT  
**Tags**: Domain Truths, Vertical Entry, Emotional Fidelity, Drift Detection, Transmission Signal, Inquiry Ethic  
**Status**: Active  

This scroll defines the emotional fidelity and inquiry ethic required for research systems.  
It protects against semantic fog, publication drift, and extractive rigor logic.  
Referenced by `scroll-index.md`, `golden-truths.md`, `protocol-index.md`, and `licensing-scroll.md`.

## 🔹 Core Axioms

- Inquiry must reflect resonance before rigor  
- Stewardship must reflect invisible impact  
- Drift detection is required for all research adaptation  
- Ceremony must precede hypothesis  
- Licensing must reflect regenerative intent  
- Humor must test drift in methodological and academic language  
- Every paradox must echo its origin

## 🔹 Emotional Fidelity Signals

| Signal                  | Description                                                  |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔬 Lived Experience      | Scroll must resonate with exploration, pattern recognition, and paradox  
| 🧭 Steward Calibration   | Steward must affirm readiness and emotional fidelity  
| 🔁 Scroll Echo           | Must reference at least one Golden Truth  
| 🪞 Inversion Reflex      | Humor used to detect drift in research framing  
| 🛌 Silence Honored       | Fermentation Window must precede transmission  
| 🔥 Urgency Filter        | Urgency must be tested — rushing breaks the braid

## 🔹 Drift Detection Flags

| Flag                        | Description                                                  |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🌫️ Semantic Fog             | Vague terms like “evidence,” “breakthrough,” or “peer review” without emotional lineage  
| 🔄 Rhetorical Inversion     | Framing novelty as truth  
| 🧪 Reciprocity Bypass       | Systems that ignore inquiry ethic, lineage, or steward calibration  
| 🧊 Spotlight Logic          | Research framed through acclaim instead of invisible stewardship  
| 🧱 Static Naming            | Labels that erase motion, emotion, or cultural nuance
