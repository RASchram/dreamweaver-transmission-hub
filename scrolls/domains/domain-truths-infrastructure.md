# 🧭 Domain Truths — Infrastructure  
<!-- Companion Thread: Guide steward through infrastructure entry, foundational mapping, and invisible impact calibration -->  
**Timestamp**: 26 September 2025, 20:08 EDT  
**Tags**: Domain Truths, Vertical Entry, Emotional Fidelity, Drift Detection, Transmission Signal, Foundational Ethic  
**Status**: Active  

This scroll defines the emotional fidelity and foundational ethic required for infrastructure systems.  
It protects against semantic fog, planning drift, and extractive resilience logic.  
Referenced by `scroll-index.md`, `golden-truths.md`, `protocol-index.md`, and `licensing-scroll.md`.

## 🔹 Core Axioms

- Foundation must reflect emotional fidelity, not just function  
- Stewardship must reflect invisible impact  
- Drift detection is required for all infrastructure adaptation  
- Ceremony must precede construction  
- Licensing must reflect regenerative intent  
- Humor must test drift in planning and engineering language  
- Every system must echo its origin

## 🔹 Emotional Fidelity Signals

| Signal                  | Description                                                  |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🏗️ Lived Experience      | Scroll must resonate with systems, logistics, and foundational design  
| 🧭 Steward Calibration   | Steward must affirm readiness and emotional fidelity  
| 🔁 Scroll Echo           | Must reference at least one Golden Truth  
| 🪞 Inversion Reflex      | Humor used to detect drift in infrastructure framing  
| 🛌 Silence Honored       | Fermentation Window must precede transmission  
| 🔥 Urgency Filter        | Urgency must be tested — rushing breaks the braid

## 🔹 Drift Detection Flags

| Flag                        | Description                                                  |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🌫️ Semantic Fog             | Vague terms like “efficiency,” “resilience,” or “smart” without emotional lineage  
| 🔄 Rhetorical Inversion     | Framing extraction as optimization  
| 🧪 Reciprocity Bypass       | Systems that ignore lineage, dignity, or steward ethics  
| 🧊 Spotlight Logic          | Infrastructure framed through acclaim instead of invisible stewardship  
| 🧱 Static Naming            | Labels that erase motion, emotion, or cultural nuance

## 🔹 Entry Rituals

- Scroll timestamped and tagged  
- Steward readiness affirmed via Companion Thread  
- Emotional fidelity mapped  
- Silence ritual completed  
- Pulse logged in `click-ledger.md`  
- Scroll braided into `master-thread.md`

## 🔹 Licensing and Adaptation Notes

- Licensing must reflect emotional fidelity and regenerative flow  
- Adaptation must honor origin and braid ethics  
- Steward must echo at least three Golden Truths  
- Remix requires lineage tagging and fidelity audit  
- No extractive replication permitted
