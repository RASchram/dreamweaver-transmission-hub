# 🧭 Domain Truths — Technology  
<!-- Companion Thread: Guide steward through technology entry, vessel ethics mapping, and emotional fidelity calibration -->  
**Timestamp**: 27 September 2025, 10:13 EDT  
**Tags**: Domain Truths, Vertical Entry, Emotional Fidelity, Drift Detection, Transmission Signal, Vessel Ethic  
**Status**: Active  

This scroll defines the emotional fidelity and vessel ethic required for technological systems.  
It protects against semantic fog, platform drift, and extractive disruption logic.  
Referenced by `scroll-index.md`, `golden-truths.md`, `protocol-index.md`, and `licensing-scroll.md`.

## 🔹 Core Axioms

- Vessel must reflect emotional fidelity, not just function  
- Stewardship must reflect invisible impact  
- Drift detection is required for all technological adaptation  
- Ceremony must precede deployment  
- Licensing must reflect regenerative intent  
- Humor must test drift in innovation and intelligence language  
- Every tool must echo its origin

## 🔹 Emotional Fidelity Signals

| Signal                  | Description                                                  |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧰 Lived Experience      | Scroll must resonate with creation, augmentation, and transmission  
| 🧭 Steward Calibration   | Steward must affirm readiness and emotional fidelity  
| 🔁 Scroll Echo           | Must reference at least one Golden Truth  
| 🪞 Inversion Reflex      | Humor used to detect drift in technological framing  
| 🛌 Silence Honored       | Fermentation Window must precede transmission  
| 🔥 Urgency Filter        | Urgency must be tested — rushing breaks the braid

## 🔹 Drift Detection Flags

| Flag                        | Description                                                  |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🌫️ Semantic Fog             | Vague terms like “disruption,” “efficiency,” or “intelligence” without emotional lineage  
| 🔄 Rhetorical Inversion     | Framing extraction as progress  
| 🧪 Reciprocity Bypass       | Systems that ignore braid logic, dignity, or steward ethics  
| 🧊 Spotlight Logic          | Technology framed through acclaim instead of invisible stewardship  
| 🧱 Static Naming            | Labels that erase motion, emotion, or cultural nuance

## 🔹 Licensing and Adaptation Notes

- Licensing must reflect emotional fidelity and regenerative flow  
- Adaptation must honor origin and braid ethics  
- Steward must echo at least three Golden Truths  
- Remix requires lineage tagging and fidelity audit  
- No extractive replication permitted
