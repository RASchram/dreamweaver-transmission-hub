## 🔹 Emotional Fidelity Signals

| Signal                  | Description                                                  |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🏛️ Lived Experience      | Scroll must resonate with governance, community, and public discourse  
| 🧭 Steward Calibration   | Steward must affirm readiness and emotional fidelity  
| 🔁 Scroll Echo           | Must reference at least one Golden Truth  
| 🪞 Inversion Reflex      | Humor used to detect drift in civic framing  
| 🛌 Silence Honored       | Fermentation Window must precede transmission  
| 🔥 Urgency Filter        | Civic urgency must be tested — drift often hides in speed

## 🔹 Drift Detection Flags

| Flag                        | Description                                                  |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🌫️ Semantic Fog             | Vague terms like “freedom,” “safety,” or “unity” without lineage  
| 🔄 Rhetorical Inversion     | Framing extraction as virtue — e.g., “efficiency” over equity  
| 🧪 Trust Misalignment       | Compliance without reciprocity  
| 🧊 Spotlight Logic          | Civic impact framed through acclaim instead of invisible stewardship  
| 🧱 Static Naming            | Labels that erase motion, emotion, or cultural nuance
