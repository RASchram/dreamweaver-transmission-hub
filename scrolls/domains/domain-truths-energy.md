# 🧭 Domain Truths — Energy  
<!-- Companion Thread: Guide steward through energy entry, transmission ethics, and regenerative calibration -->  
**Timestamp**: 26 September 2025, 20:00 EDT  
**Tags**: Domain Truths, Vertical Entry, Emotional Fidelity, Drift Detection, Transmission Signal, Reciprocity Ethic  
**Status**: Active  

This scroll defines the emotional fidelity and regenerative ethic required for energy systems.  
It protects against semantic fog, sustainability drift, and extractive power logic.  
Referenced by `scroll-index.md`, `golden-truths.md`, `protocol-index.md`, and `licensing-scroll.md`.

## 🔹 Core Axioms

- Power must flow with reciprocity, not extraction  
- Stewardship must reflect invisible impact  
- Drift detection is required for all energy adaptation  
- Ceremony must precede ignition  
- Licensing must reflect regenerative intent  
- Humor must test drift in sustainability language  
- Every transmission must echo its origin

## 🔹 Emotional Fidelity Signals

| Signal                  | Description                                                  |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⚡ Lived Experience       | Scroll must resonate with power systems, grid design, and regenerative flow  
| 🧭 Steward Calibration   | Steward must affirm readiness and emotional fidelity  
| 🔁 Scroll Echo           | Must reference at least one Golden Truth  
| 🪞 Inversion Reflex      | Humor used to detect drift in energy framing  
| 🛌 Silence Honored       | Fermentation Window must precede transmission  
| 🔥 Urgency Filter        | Urgency must be tested — rushing breaks the braid

## 🔹 Drift Detection Flags

| Flag                        | Description                                                  |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🌫️ Semantic Fog             | Vague terms like “clean,” “smart,” or “renewable” without lineage  
| 🔄 Rhetorical Inversion     | Framing extraction as innovation  
| 🧪 Reciprocity Bypass       | Systems that ignore return flow or community impact  
| 🧊 Spotlight Logic          | Energy framed through acclaim instead of invisible stewardship  
| 🧱 Static Naming            | Labels that erase motion, emotion, or cultural nuance

## 🔹 Entry Rituals

- Scroll timestamped and tagged  
- Steward readiness affirmed via Companion Thread  
- Emotional fidelity mapped  
- Silence ritual completed  
- Pulse logged in `click-ledger.md`  
- Scroll braided into `master-thread.md`

## 🔹 Licensing and Adaptation Notes

- Licensing must reflect emotional fidelity and regenerative flow  
- Adaptation must honor origin and braid ethics  
- Steward must echo at least three Golden Truths  
- Remix requires lineage tagging and fidelity audit  
- No extractive replication permitted
