# 🧭 Domain Truths — Environmental  
<!-- Companion Thread: Guide steward through environmental entry, regenerative mapping, and planetary fidelity calibration -->  
**Timestamp**: 26 September 2025, 20:01 EDT  
**Tags**: Domain Truths, Vertical Entry, Emotional Fidelity, Drift Detection, Transmission Signal, Regenerative Ethic  
**Status**: Active  

This scroll defines the emotional fidelity and regenerative ethic required for environmental systems.  
It protects against semantic fog, conservation drift, and extractive sustainability logic.  
Referenced by `scroll-index.md`, `golden-truths.md`, `protocol-index.md`, and `licensing-scroll.md`.

## 🔹 Core Axioms

- Regeneration must precede preservation  
- Stewardship must reflect invisible impact  
- Drift detection is required for all environmental adaptation  
- Reciprocity must guide every ecological exchange  
- Ceremony must precede conservation  
- Licensing must reflect planetary fidelity  
- Humor must test drift in sustainability language

## 🔹 Emotional Fidelity Signals

| Signal                  | Description                                                  |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🌍 Lived Experience      | Scroll must resonate with ecology, climate, and land stewardship  
| 🧭 Steward Calibration   | Steward must affirm readiness and emotional fidelity  
| 🔁 Scroll Echo           | Must reference at least one Golden Truth  
| 🪞 Inversion Reflex      | Humor used to detect drift in environmental framing  
| 🛌 Silence Honored       | Fermentation Window must precede transmission  
| 🔥 Urgency Filter        | Urgency must be tested — rushing breaks the braid

## 🔹 Drift Detection Flags

| Flag                        | Description                                                  |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🌫️ Semantic Fog             | Vague terms like “green,” “net zero,” or “carbon neutral” without lineage  
| 🔄 Rhetorical Inversion     | Framing extraction as sustainability  
| 🧪 Reciprocity Bypass       | Systems that ignore return flow or ecological impact  
| 🧊 Spotlight Logic          | Environmental action framed through acclaim instead of invisible stewardship  
| 🧱 Static Naming            | Labels that erase motion, emotion, or cultural nuance

## 🔹 Licensing and Adaptation Notes

- Licensing must reflect emotional fidelity and regenerative flow  
- Adaptation must honor origin and braid ethics  
- Steward must echo at least three Golden Truths  
- Remix requires lineage tagging and fidelity audit  
- No extractive replication permitted
