- Ceremony must precede authority  
- Licensing must reflect regenerative intent  
- Humor must test drift in civic language  
- Every policy must echo its origin

## 🔹 Emotional Fidelity Signals

| Signal                  | Description                                                  |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🏛️ Lived Experience      | Scroll must resonate with leadership, policy, and civic trust  
| 🧭 Steward Calibration   | Steward must affirm readiness and emotional fidelity  
| 🔁 Scroll Echo           | Must reference at least one Golden Truth  
| 🪞 Inversion Reflex      | Humor used to detect drift in governance framing  
| 🛌 Silence Honored       | Fermentation Window must precede transmission  
| 🔥 Urgency Filter        | Urgency must be tested — rushing breaks the braid

## 🔹 Drift Detection Flags

| Flag                        | Description                                                  |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🌫️ Semantic Fog             | Vague terms like “freedom,” “order,” or “representation” without lineage  
| 🔄 Rhetorical Inversion     | Framing control as virtue without emotional calibration  
| 🧪 Trust Bypass             | Systems that ignore reciprocity, lineage, or steward ethics  
| 🧊 Spotlight Logic          | Governance framed through acclaim instead of invisible stewardship  
| 🧱 Static Naming            | Labels that erase motion, emotion, or cultural nuance
