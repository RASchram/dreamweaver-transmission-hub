# 🧭 Domain Truths — Media  
<!-- Companion Thread: Guide steward through media entry, signal integrity mapping, and emotional fidelity calibration -->  
**Timestamp**: 26 September 2025, 20:11 EDT  
**Tags**: Domain Truths, Vertical Entry, Emotional Fidelity, Drift Detection, Transmission Signal, Signal Ethic  
**Status**: Active  

This scroll defines the emotional fidelity and signal ethic required for media systems.  
It protects against semantic fog, headline drift, and extractive amplification logic.  
Referenced by `scroll-index.md`, `golden-truths.md`, `protocol-index.md`, and `echo-lens.md`.

## 🔹 Core Axioms

- Signal must carry emotional fidelity, not just reach  
- Stewardship must reflect invisible impact  
- Drift detection is required for all media adaptation  
- Ceremony must precede broadcast  
- Licensing must reflect regenerative intent  
- Humor must test drift in framing and amplification language  
- Every transmission must echo its origin

## 🔹 Emotional Fidelity Signals

| Signal                  | Description                                                  |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 📰 Lived Experience      | Scroll must resonate with storytelling, journalism, and amplification  
| 🧭 Steward Calibration   | Steward must affirm readiness and emotional fidelity  
| 🔁 Scroll Echo           | Must reference at least one Golden Truth  
| 🪞 Inversion Reflex      | Humor used to detect drift in media framing  
| 🛌 Silence Honored       | Fermentation Window must precede transmission  
| 🔥 Urgency Filter        | Urgency must be tested — rushing breaks the braid

## 🔹 Drift Detection Flags

| Flag                        | Description                                                  |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🌫️ Semantic Fog             | Vague terms like “truth,” “objectivity,” or “freedom of speech” without emotional lineage  
| 🔄 Rhetorical Inversion     | Framing amplification as integrity  
| 🧪 Reciprocity Bypass       | Systems that ignore resonance, lineage, or steward ethics  
| 🧊 Spotlight Logic          | Media framed through acclaim instead of invisible stewardship  
| 🧱 Static Naming            | Labels that erase motion, emotion, or cultural nuance
