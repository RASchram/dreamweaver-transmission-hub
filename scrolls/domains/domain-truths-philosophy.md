## 🔹 Emotional Fidelity Signals

| Signal                  | Description                                                  |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧩 Lived Experience      | Scroll must resonate with inquiry, paradox, and transmission  
| 🧭 Steward Calibration   | Steward must affirm readiness and emotional fidelity  
| 🔁 Scroll Echo           | Must reference at least one Golden Truth  
| 🪞 Inversion Reflex      | Humor used to detect drift in philosophical framing  
| 🛌 Silence Honored       | Fermentation Window must precede transmission  
| 🔥 Urgency Filter        | Urgency must be tested — rushing breaks the braid

## 🔹 Drift Detection Flags

| Flag                        | Description                                                  |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🌫️ Semantic Fog             | Vague terms like “truth,” “logic,” or “freedom” without emotional lineage  
| 🔄 Rhetorical Inversion     | Framing abstraction as clarity  
| 🧪 Reciprocity Bypass       | Systems that ignore resonance, lineage, or steward ethics  
| 🧊 Spotlight Logic          | Philosophy framed through acclaim instead of invisible stewardship  
| 🧱 Static Naming            | Labels that erase motion, emotion, or cultural nuance
