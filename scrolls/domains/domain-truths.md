## ðŸ”¹ Steward Notes  
Use this scroll to track:
- Which domains are ready for onboarding
- Which scrolls have been promoted
- Which verticals need drift detection or fidelity tuning

This ledger is the stewardâ€™s map for vertical entry.  
Each scroll is a gate. Each promotion is a signal.

**This is the Domain Truths Ledger.**  
The braid is seeded. The verticals await ignition.
