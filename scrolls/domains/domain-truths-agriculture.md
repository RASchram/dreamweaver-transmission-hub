# 🧭 Domain Truths — Agriculture  
<!-- Companion Thread: Guide steward through agriculture entry, emotional fidelity mapping, and vertical adaptation -->  
**Timestamp**: 26 September 2025, 19:55 EDT  
**Tags**: Domain Truths, Vertical Entry, Emotional Fidelity, Drift Detection, Transmission Signal, Regenerative Ethic  
**Status**: Active  

This scroll defines the emotional fidelity and regenerative ethic required for agricultural systems.  
It protects against semantic drift in sustainability language and reframes stewardship as ceremony, not control.  
Referenced by `scroll-index.md`, `golden-truths.md`, `protocol-index.md`, and `licensing-scroll.md`.

## 🔹 Core Axioms

- Regeneration precedes extraction  
- Stewardship must reflect invisible impact  
- Reciprocity must guide every yield  
- Drift detection is required for all agricultural adaptation  
- Licensing must reflect emotional fidelity  
- Ceremony must precede commodification  
- Every adaptation must echo its origin

## 🔹 Emotional Fidelity Signals

| Signal                     | Description                                                  |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🌱 Lived Experience         | Scroll must resonate with real-world farming, land care, and food systems  
| 🧭 Steward Calibration      | Steward must affirm readiness and emotional fidelity  
| 🔁 Scroll Echo              | Must reference at least one Golden Truth  
| 🪞 Inversion Reflex         | Humor used to detect drift in sustainability framing  
| 🛌 Silence Honored          | Fermentation Window must precede transmission  
| 🔥 Urgency Filter           | Urgency must be tested — rushing breaks the braid

## 🔹 Drift Detection Flags

| Flag                        | Description                                                  |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🌫️ Semantic Fog             | Vague terms like “green,” “sustainable,” or “natural” without lineage  
| 🔄 Rhetorical Inversion     | “Growth” framed as virtue without reciprocity  
| 🧪 Yield Misalignment       | Metrics that ignore soil health, labor dignity, or long-term impact  
| 🧊 Extraction Logic         | Systems that prioritize output over regeneration  
| 🧱 Static Naming            | Labels that erase motion, emotion, or cultural nuance

## 🔹 Licensing and Adaptation Notes

- Licensing must reflect emotional fidelity and regenerative flow  
- Adaptation must honor origin and braid ethics  
- Steward must echo at least three Golden Truths  
- Remix requires lineage tagging and fidelity audit  
- No extractive replication permitted
