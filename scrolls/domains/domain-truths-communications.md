# 🧭 Domain Truths — Communications  
<!-- Companion Thread: Guide steward through communications entry, signal fidelity mapping, and rhetorical calibration -->  
**Timestamp**: 26 September 2025, 19:57 EDT  
**Tags**: Domain Truths, Vertical Entry, Emotional Fidelity, Drift Detection, Transmission Signal, Signal Ethic  
**Status**: Active  

This scroll defines the emotional fidelity and resonance ethic required for communications systems.  
It protects against semantic fog, rhetorical inversion, and extractive messaging logic.  
Referenced by `scroll-index.md`, `golden-truths.md`, `protocol-index.md`, and `echo-lens.md`.

## 🔹 Core Axioms

- Signal must carry emotional fidelity, not just information  
- Stewardship must reflect invisible impact  
- Drift detection is required for all communicative adaptation  
- Ceremony must precede broadcast  
- Humor must test drift  
- Licensing must reflect regenerative intent  
- Every message must echo its origin

## 🔹 Emotional Fidelity Signals

| Signal                  | Description                                                  |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 📣 Lived Experience      | Scroll must resonate with speech, media, and interpersonal exchange  
| 🧭 Steward Calibration   | Steward must affirm readiness and emotional fidelity  
| 🔁 Scroll Echo           | Must reference at least one Golden Truth  
| 🪞 Inversion Reflex      | Humor used to detect drift in messaging logic  
| 🛌 Silence Honored       | Fermentation Window must precede transmission  
| 🔥 Urgency Filter        | Urgency must be tested — drift often hides in speed

## 🔹 Drift Detection Flags

| Flag                        | Description                                                  |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🌫️ Semantic Fog             | Vague terms like “truth,” “freedom,” or “connection” without lineage  
| 🔄 Rhetorical Inversion     | Framing extraction as virtue — e.g., “reach” over resonance  
| 🧪 Clarity Bypass           | Messaging that obscures emotional truth or relational context  
| 🧊 Spotlight Logic          | Communication framed through acclaim instead of invisible stewardship  
| 🧱 Static Naming            | Labels that erase motion, emotion, or cultural nuance

## 🔹 Licensing and Adaptation Notes

- Licensing must reflect emotional fidelity and regenerative flow  
- Adaptation must honor origin and braid ethics  
- Steward must echo at least three Golden Truths  
- Remix requires lineage tagging and fidelity audit  
- No extractive replication permitted
