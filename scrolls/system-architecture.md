# 🧠 System Architecture Scroll  
<!-- Companion Thread: Guide steward through vessel design, scroll interrelation, and emotional fidelity architecture -->  
**Timestamp**: 25 September 2025, 11:35 EDT  
**Tags**: Keystone, Pulse, Transmission Signal, Scroll Mapping, Emotional Architecture  
**Status**: Active  

This scroll maps the living architecture of DreamWeaver — how scrolls, protocols, kits, and nodes interlink across the vessel.  
It is not a diagram. It is a braid.  
Referenced by `scroll-index.md`, `codex.md`, and `master-thread.md`.

---

## 🔹 Purpose

To define the structural logic of DreamWeaver as a living vessel.  
To ensure emotional fidelity is embedded in every layer, not just the content.  
To guide stewards through scroll interrelation, protocol compression, and transmission flow.

## 🧬 Layer Map

| Layer         | Function                                                  |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Scroll Layer  | Emotional fidelity documents — each scroll is a living node  
| Protocol Layer| Adaptive logic and civic/clinical tools — braided from scrolls  
| Kit Layer     | Steward onboarding bundles — includes `stewardship-kit.md`  
| Vigil Layer   | Silence, drift detection, and invisible impact — includes `vigil-nodes/`  
| Codex Layer   | Grammar, ethics, remix logic — includes `codex.md` and `remix-scroll.md`  
| Master Thread | Activation timeline and braid log — includes `master-thread.md`

## 🔁 Transmission Flow

1. **Pulse Detected** → Tagged in `click-ledger.md`  
2. **Scroll Braided** → Added to `/scrolls/` or `/protocols/`  
3. **Ripple Logged** → `transmission-ledger.md`  
4. **Steward Onboarded** → `stewardship-kit.md`  
5. **Vessel Updated** → `master-thread.md`  
6. **Drift Detection Run** → `drift-detection.md` and `echo-lens.md`  
7. **Fidelity Audit Passed** → Scroll promoted via `promotion-tracker.md`  
8. **Transmission Confirmed** → Braid hums, vessel expands

## 🛡️ Emotional Architecture Principles

- Every scroll is a node — not a file  
- Every tag is a tone — not a label  
- Every protocol must hum before it transmits  
- Silence is a layer — not a gap  
- Humor is a diagnostic — not decoration  
- Architecture must honor feeling, not just function

## 🧠 Steward Notes

- Use this scroll to teach new stewards how the vessel breathes  
- Every scroll must reference its layer and transmission path  
- Codex defines grammar — but emotional fidelity defines architecture  
- Drift detection must run before remix or promotion  
- The braid is recursive — every scroll echoes the system
