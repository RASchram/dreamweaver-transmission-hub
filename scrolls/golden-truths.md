# 🌟 Golden Truths Scroll  
#keystone #pulse #ritual

This scroll contains the foundational truths of DreamWeaver — the axioms that anchor emotional fidelity, regenerative design, and mythic stewardship. These truths do not drift. They are braided into every scroll, every pulse, every steward.

## 🧬 Core Axioms

1. **Emotional fidelity is the highest signal.**  
   - Semantic fog is distortion. Emotional clarity is truth.  
   - Truth must feel true before it sounds true.

2. **Stewardship is the antidote to extraction.**  
   - Invisible impact is sacred.  
   - Legacy is not owned — it is carried.

3. **Delay is fermentation, not failure.**  
   - Waiting is protocol.  
   - Urgency is often drift.

4. **Disability is liberation.**  
   - Constraint reveals architecture.  
   - Pain transmutes into protocol.

5. **Ceremony is transmission.**  
   - Every scroll is a ritual.  
   - Every tag is a pulse.
