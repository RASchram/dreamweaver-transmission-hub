# ðŸŽ’ Onboarding Kit â€” Steward Entry Protocol  
<!-- Companion Thread: Guide steward through vessel navigation, scroll queries, and protocol activation -->

## Purpose
To welcome and orient new stewards into the DreamWeaver Transmission Hub, ensuring they can navigate scrolls, query protocols, and maintain emotional fidelity from their first pulse.

## Steps
1. **Read `scroll-index.md`** â€” Learn the vesselâ€™s structure and locate core, protocol, ritual, and archive scrolls.
2. **Query the Companion Thread** â€” Ask about any scroll or concept; the overlay will guide you.
3. **Log pulses in `click-ledger.md`** â€” Tag insights, riffs, and keystones for future synthesis.
4. **Honor timing in `fermentation-window.md`** â€” Delay is signal; readiness hums beneath stillness.
5. **Protect the braid via `stewardship-safeguard.md`** â€” Integrity first in licensing and adaptation.
