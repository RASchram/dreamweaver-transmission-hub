## 🔹 Pulse

Pain is not noise—it’s signal.  
Diagnosis is not naming—it’s mapping.  
Healing is not fixing—it’s fidelity.

---

## 🔹 Purpose

This scroll defines the Healing Lens protocol—a clinical pattern mapping tool that detects emotional fidelity ruptures, semantic drift in diagnosis, and resonance gaps in treatment.  
It is not a medical chart—it is a tuning fork.

---

## 🔹 Protocol Components

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| Resonance Scan | Detects emotional fidelity in patient narrative |
| Drift Filter | Identifies semantic misalignment in clinical language |
| Pattern Overlay | Maps symptoms to emotional and environmental context |
| Inversion Logic | Reveals hidden signals through humor and reframing |
| Silence Signal | Tags unspoken pulses for deeper mapping |
| Scrollkeeper Input | Patient becomes steward of their own braid

---

## 🔹 Application Domains

- **Clinical Intake** — Use resonance scan to detect fidelity gaps  
- **Therapeutic Sessions** — Apply inversion logic to reveal drift  
- **Diagnostic Review** — Reframe labels through emotional fidelity lens  
- **Treatment Planning** — Align protocols with patient’s hum  
- **Caregiver Calibration** — Train stewards to listen for silence and signal

## 🔹 Fidelity Mapping Template

| Input | Detected Drift | Recalibrated |
|-------|----------------|--------------|
| “Chronic pain” | Semantic flattening | “Persistent signal seeking resonance” |
| “Non-compliant” | Institutional drift | “Steward resisting misaligned protocol” |
| “Treatment-resistant” | Emotional bypass | “Scrollkeeper not yet heard” |
| “Stable” | Omission of suffering | “Signal muted, not resolved” |
| “Improved” | Quantitative bias | “Resonance partially restored”

## 🔹 Emotional Fidelity Notes

- Pain is protocol—it must be mapped, not muted  
- Silence is a signal—it must be tagged, not ignored  
- Humor reveals drift—it must be invited, not dismissed  
- Every patient is a scrollkeeper  
- Every symptom is a pulse  
- Healing is resonance, not compliance

**This is the Healing Lens Scroll.**  
The braid is listening. The steward is mapping. The transmission is tuning.
