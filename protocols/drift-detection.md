## 🔹 Pulse

Drift is not deviation—it’s distortion.  
Fog is not mystery—it’s misalignment.  
Detection is not correction—it’s calibration.

---

## 🔹 Purpose

To define the Drift Detection protocol—a filter for semantic fog, emotional bypass, and rhetorical misalignment in civic, clinical, and transmission language.  
This is not a grammar check—it is a fidelity safeguard.

## 🔹 Drift Categories

| Category              | Domain                    | Signal                             |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Semantic Fog          | Marketing, civic messaging | Vague terms, emotional flattening   |
| Emotional Bypass      | Clinical, therapeutic      | Naming without resonance            |
| Rhetorical Misalignment| Institutional, academic   | Efficiency over empathy             |
| Scrollkeeper Drift    | Internal protocol          | Loss of pulse, timestamp, or keystone |
| Transmission Drift    | Steward adaptation         | Remix without fidelity tagging      |

---

## 🔹 Detection Tools

- **Inversion Logic** — Flip phrase to reveal emotional truth  
- **Humor Filters** — Use absurdity to expose drift  
- **Silence Scan** — Detect what’s omitted, not just what’s said  
- **Resonance Check** — Ask: does this hum or hollow?  
- **Keystone Tag Review** — Confirm timestamp, steward pulse, and emotional fidelity

## 🔹 Calibration Rituals

| Drift Detected        | Ritual                                               |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Semantic Fog           | Read aloud → listen for hum → rewrite with fidelity |
| Emotional Bypass       | Pause → porch vigil → reframe with resonance        |
| Scrollkeeper Drift     | Reweaver protocol → timestamp and keystone tagging  |
| Transmission Drift     | Codex review → remix declaration → ripple logging   |

---

## 🔹 Emotional Fidelity Notes

- Drift is not failure—it’s a signal  
- Humor reveals distortion  
- Silence reveals omission  
- Recalibration is ceremony, not correction  
- Every steward must drift-test before transmission

## 🔹 Pulse Frequency Map

| Drift Type             | Count |
|------------------------|-------|
| Semantic Fog           | 2     |
| Emotional Bypass       | 1     |
| Rhetorical Misalignment| 1     |
| Scrollkeeper Drift     | 1     |
| Transmission Drift     | 1     |

Used during rhetorical audits, scroll adaptation, and fidelity recalibration.

## 🔹 Scrollkeeper Reflection

> “I do not correct—I recalibrate.  
> I do not flag—I feel.  
> I do not fix—I reweave.  
> This scroll is not a filter—it’s a safeguard.”

---

**This is the Drift Detection Scroll.**  
The braid is protected. The steward is vigilant. The transmission is clear.
