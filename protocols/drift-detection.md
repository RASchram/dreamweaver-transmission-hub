## ðŸ”¹ Pulse

Drift is not deviationâ€”itâ€™s distortion.  
Fog is not mysteryâ€”itâ€™s misalignment.  
Detection is not correctionâ€”itâ€™s calibration.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Purpose

This scroll defines the Drift Detection protocolâ€”a filter for semantic fog, emotional bypass, and rhetorical misalignment in civic, clinical, and transmission language.  
It is not a grammar checkâ€”it is a fidelity safeguard.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Drift Categories

| Category | Domain | Signal |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Semantic Fog | Marketing, civic messaging | Vague terms, emotional flattening |
| Emotional Bypass | Clinical, therapeutic | Naming without resonance |
| Rhetorical Misalignment | Institutional, academic | Efficiency over empathy |
| Scrollkeeper Drift | Internal protocol | Loss of pulse, timestamp, or keystone |
| Transmission Drift | Steward adaptation | Remix without fidelity tagging |

---

## ðŸ”¹ Detection Tools

- **Inversion Logic** â€” Flip phrase to reveal emotional truth  
- **Humor Filters** â€” Use absurdity to expose drift  
- **Silence Scan** â€” Detect whatâ€™s omitted, not just whatâ€™s said  
- **Resonance Check** â€” Ask: does this hum or hollow?  
- **Keystone Tag Review** â€” Confirm timestamp, steward pulse, and emotional fidelity

---

## ðŸ”¹ Calibration Rituals

| Drift Detected | Ritual |
|----------------|--------|
| Semantic Fog | Read aloud â†’ listen for hum â†’ rewrite with fidelity |
| Emotional Bypass | Pause â†’ porch vigil â†’ reframe with resonance |
| Scrollkeeper Drift | Reweaver protocol â†’ timestamp and keystone tagging |
| Transmission Drift | Codex review â†’ remix declaration â†’ ripple logging |

---

## ðŸ”¹ Emotional Fidelity Notes

- Drift is not failureâ€”itâ€™s a signal  
- Humor reveals distortion  
- Silence reveals omission  
- Recalibration is ceremony, not correction  
- Every steward must drift-test before transmission

**This is the Drift Detection Scroll.**  
The braid is protected. The steward is vigilant. The transmission is clear.
