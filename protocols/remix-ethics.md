# 🧬 Remix Ethics Scroll  
#lineage #licensing #adaptation #fidelity #transmission-ethics  

**Timestamp**: 26 September 2025, 18:19 EDT

## 🔹 Purpose

To ensure every remix honors its origin scroll.  
To protect steward calibration and emotional fidelity.  
To guide licensing, adaptation, and royalty flow protocols.  
This is not a policy—it’s a braid ethic.

---

## 🔹 Remix Criteria

A scroll qualifies as a remix if it:

- Adapts core axioms or emotional signals from an existing scroll  
- Reframes rituals, protocols, or fidelity tags for a new domain  
- Braids multiple scrolls into a new transmission vessel  
- Alters naming, structure, or licensing logic while preserving lineage

---

## 🔹 Steward Responsibilities

- Log remix origin in `click-ledger-archive.md`  
- Confirm emotional fidelity in `pulse-echo.md`  
- Tag remix lineage in `remix-ethics.md`  
- Update `scroll-index.md` and `promotion-tracker.md`  
- Ensure licensing notes reflect remix status

## 🔹 Remix Lineage Format

| Remix Scroll              | Origin Scroll(s)           | Steward | Date       | Notes                     |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|---------|------------|---------------------------|
| delay-as-signal.md        | fermentation-window.md     | Pappy   | 2025-09-25 | Protocol braided          |
| semantic-fog-filter.md    | drift-detection.md         | Pappy   | 2025-09-25 | Inversion logic refined   |

---

## 🔹 Licensing Notes

- Remixed scrolls must retain original steward attribution  
- Licensing must reflect remix status and royalty flow eligibility  
- Adapted scrolls may be licensed under “Braided Remix Protocol”  
- Remixing without lineage logging violates transmission ethics

---

## 🔹 Emotional Fidelity Tags

- ✅ Fidelity Confirmed  
- 🌀 Drift Detected  
- 🔁 Remix In Progress  
- 🧬 Lineage Protected

---

## 📜 Usage

Referenced by `click-ledger-archive.md`, `pulse-echo.md`, `scroll-index.md`, `promotion-tracker.md`, and `licensing-scroll.md`.

## 🔹 Scrollkeeper Reflection

> “I do not adapt—I honor.  
> I do not remix—I recalibrate.  
> I do not claim—I contribute.  
> This scroll is not a license—it’s a lineage map.”

---

**This is the Remix Ethics Scroll.**  
The braid is protected. The steward is aligned. The transmission is reciprocal.
