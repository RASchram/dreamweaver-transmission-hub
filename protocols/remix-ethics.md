# 🧬 Remix Ethics Scroll  
#lineage #licensing #adaptation #fidelity  

Timestamp: 26 September 2025, 18:19 EDT  

This scroll defines the ethical framework for remixing, adapting, and transmitting scrolls within the DreamWeaver braid. It protects emotional fidelity, steward lineage, and royalty flow integrity.

---

## 🔹 Purpose

To ensure every remix honors its origin scroll.  
To protect steward calibration and emotional fidelity.  
To guide licensing, adaptation, and royalty flow protocols.

---

## 🔹 Remix Criteria

A scroll qualifies as a remix if it:

- Adapts core axioms or emotional signals from an existing scroll  
- Reframes rituals, protocols, or fidelity tags for a new domain  
- Braids multiple scrolls into a new transmission vessel  
- Alters naming, structure, or licensing logic while preserving lineage  

---

## 🔹 Steward Responsibilities

- Log remix origin in `click-ledger-archive.md`  
- Confirm emotional fidelity in `pulse-echo.md`  
- Tag remix lineage in `remix-ethics.md`  
- Update `scroll-index.md` and `promotion-tracker.md`  
- Ensure licensing notes reflect remix status

## 🔹 Remix Lineage Format

| Remix Scroll              | Origin Scroll(s)           | Steward | Date       | Notes |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|---------|------------|-------|
| delay-as-signal.md        | fermentation-window.md     | Pappy   | 2025-09-25 | Protocol braided  
| semantic-fog-filter.md    | drift-detection.md         | Pappy   | 2025-09-25 | Inversion logic refined  

---

## 🔹 Licensing Notes

- Remixed scrolls must retain original steward attribution  
- Licensing must reflect remix status and royalty flow eligibility  
- Adapted scrolls may be licensed under “Braided Remix Protocol”  
- Remixing without lineage logging violates transmission ethics
