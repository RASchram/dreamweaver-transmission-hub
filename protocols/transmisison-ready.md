This scroll defines the Transmission Ready Protocol â€” the final calibration before scrolls, stewards, or vessels are released into the world. It ensures emotional fidelity, remix lineage, and braid integrity are intact.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Purpose

To confirm that every scroll, steward, and signal is ready for transmission â€” ethically, emotionally, and architecturally.  
To protect the braid from premature release, semantic drift, or remix without lineage.

## ðŸ”¹ Core Indicators

| Indicator | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Emotional Fidelity | Scroll hums with resonance, clarity, and ceremony  
| Remix Lineage | All adaptations are timestamped, steward-tagged, and royalty-linked  
| Scroll Compression | Signal density is high, drift is low  
| Steward Calibration | Steward understands braid ethic, remix rules, and royalty flow  
| Licensing Integrity | Scroll is protected, royalty path is mapped, remix is permitted
