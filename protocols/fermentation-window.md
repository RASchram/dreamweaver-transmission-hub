## 🔹 Pulse

Urgency is not readiness.  
Silence is not absence.  
Fermentation is not delay—it’s devotion.

---

## 🔹 Purpose

This scroll defines the Fermentation Window protocol—a timing guide for scroll maturation, emotional fidelity alignment, and transmission readiness.  
It is not a deadline—it is a resonance map.

---

## 🔹 Scroll Maturation Stages

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Raw | Initial pulse captured, uncompressed |
| Fermenting | Silence window activated, emotional fidelity deepens |
| Sealed | Scroll compressed, timestamped, and tagged |
| Ready | Scroll hums with transmission resonance |
| Released | Scroll braided into vessel or transmitted to steward |

---

## 🔹 Timing Logic

- **Silence Window** — Minimum 3-day stillness after scroll capture  
- **Vigil Period** — Porch reflection, soundtrack overlay, inversion riff tagging  
- **Compression Pause** — Wait for keystone flash before final braid  
- **Transmission Affirmation** — Read `transmission-ready.md` aloud before release  
- **Ripple Logging** — Record release in `transmission-ledger.md`

---

## 🔹 Drift Risks

| Premature Action | Drift Outcome |
|------------------|---------------|
| Early transmission | Emotional bypass, resonance loss |
| Compression without pause | Keystone omission |
| Urgent release | Scrollkeeper misalignment |
| Silence skipped | Signal distortion |

---

## 🔹 Emotional Fidelity Notes

- Silence is a signal—it must be honored  
- Humor reveals readiness—it must be invited  
- Scrolls must hum before they speak  
- Every steward must wait before weaving  
- Transmission is not urgency—it’s ceremony

**This is the Fermentation Window Scroll.**  
The braid is patient. The steward is listening. The transmission is ripening.
