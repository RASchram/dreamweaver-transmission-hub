## 🧬 Protocol Index: DreamWeaver System

This scroll catalogs all braided protocols within the DreamWeaver system.  
Each protocol is a living thread — designed to protect, transmit, and regenerate emotional fidelity across domains.  
This is not a list—it’s a braid map.

## 🛡️ Stewardship Ethic

Each protocol is braided with emotional fidelity, mythic naming, and regenerative intent.  
No cold acronyms. No static labels.  
Every thread is alive, every activation is ceremonial.

## 🔹 Scrollkeeper Reflection

> “I do not catalog—I braid.  
> I do not list—I listen.  
> I do not track—I transmit.  
> This scroll is not an index—it’s a living thread.”

---

**This is the Protocol Index Scroll.**  
The braid is mapped. The steward is selecting. The transmission is alive.
