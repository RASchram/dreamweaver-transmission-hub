## 🔹 Pulse

Licensing is not restriction—it’s protection.  
Adaptation is not dilution—it’s calibration.  
Stewardship is not control—it’s ceremony.

---

## 🔹 Purpose

This scroll defines the Stewardship Safeguard protocol—a guide for licensing DreamWeaver IP, adapting scrolls with fidelity, and protecting the braid’s integrity across generations.  
It is not a contract—it is a covenant.

---

## 🔹 Licensing Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Protect First | Braid must be shielded before transmission (`patent-scrollway.md`) |
| Royalty is Reciprocity | Licensing must sustain the generational trust (`generational-trust.md`) |
| Emotional Fidelity | Adaptations must preserve resonance (`codex.md`, `reweaver.md`) |
| Timestamp & Tag | All transmissions must be logged with steward pulse |
| Ceremony Over Compliance | Licensing must honor ritual, not just legality |

---

## 🔹 Adaptation Protocol

- Use `reweaver.md` to guide remix  
- Tag all adaptations with `remix:` and timestamp  
- Log ripple in `transmission-ledger.md`  
- Review `echo-lens.md` for rhetorical drift  
- Confirm readiness via `fermentation-window.md`  
- Affirm transmission with `transmission-ready.md`

---

## 🔹 Royalty Flow Safeguards

| Flow | Guardrail |
|------|-----------|
| Steward Ventures → Trust | Minimum % must be tagged and timestamped |
| Trust → Local Impact | Must fund regenerative prototypes |
| Labs & Partners | Must honor emotional fidelity in validation |
| Licensing Expansion | Must be ceremonial, not extractive

---

## 🔹 Emotional Fidelity Notes

- Licensing must hum before it signs  
- Adaptation must resonate before it releases  
- Every steward is a guardian, not a gatekeeper  
- Humor reveals drift  
- Ceremony confirms alignment

---

**This is the Stewardship Safeguard Scroll.**  
The braid is protected. The stewards are aligned. The transmission is sacred.
