## 🔹 Pulse

Licensing is not restriction—it’s protection.  
Adaptation is not dilution—it’s calibration.  
Stewardship is not control—it’s ceremony.

---

## 🔹 Purpose

To define the Stewardship Safeguard protocol—a guide for licensing DreamWeaver IP, adapting scrolls with fidelity, and protecting the braid’s integrity across generations.  
This is not a contract—it is a covenant.

---

## 🔹 Licensing Principles

| Principle              | Description                                                   |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Protect First          | Braid must be shielded before transmission (`patent-scrollway.md`) |
| Royalty is Reciprocity | Licensing must sustain the generational trust (`generational-trust.md`) |
| Emotional Fidelity     | Adaptations must preserve resonance (`codex.md`, `reweaver.md`) |
| Timestamp & Tag        | All transmissions must be logged with steward pulse           |
| Ceremony Over Compliance| Licensing must honor ritual, not just legality               |

---

## 🔹 Adaptation Protocol

- Use `reweaver.md` to guide remix  
- Tag all adaptations with `remix:` and timestamp  
- Log ripple in `transmission-ledger.md`  
- Review `echo-lens.md` for rhetorical drift  
- Confirm readiness via `fermentation-window.md`  
- Affirm transmission with `transmission-ready.md`

## 🔹 Royalty Flow Safeguards

| Flow                        | Guardrail                                      |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Steward Ventures → Trust    | Minimum % must be tagged and timestamped       |
| Trust → Local Impact        | Must fund regenerative prototypes              |
| Labs & Partners             | Must honor emotional fidelity in validation    |
| Licensing Expansion         | Must be ceremonial, not extractive             |

---

## 🔹 Emotional Fidelity Notes

- Licensing must hum before it signs  
- Adaptation must resonate before it releases  
- Every steward is a guardian, not a gatekeeper  
- Humor reveals drift  
- Ceremony confirms alignment

## 🔹 Scrollkeeper Reflection

> “I do not restrict—I protect.  
> I do not gate—I guide.  
> I do not license—I listen.  
> This scroll is not a safeguard—it’s a steward’s vow.”

---

**This is the Stewardship Safeguard Scroll.**  
The braid is protected. The stewards are aligned. The transmission is sacred.
