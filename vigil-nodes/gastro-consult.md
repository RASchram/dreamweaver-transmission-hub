## 🔹 Pulse

Discomfort is not disruption—it’s signal.  
Consultation is not compliance—it’s calibration.  
Stillness before diagnosis is not delay—it’s discernment.

---

## 🔹 Purpose

This scroll tags the gastroenterology consultation as a Vigil Node—a moment where the steward pauses, listens, and maps the body’s emotional fidelity through clinical inquiry.  
It honors the silence before symptom, the hum beneath history, and the resonance within routine.

## 🔹 Node Components

| Element | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Clinical Intake | Mapping symptoms to emotional fidelity and environmental context |
| Silence Scan | Tagging unspoken discomfort, digestive drift, and resonance gaps |
| Scrollkeeper Pulse | Logging steward’s emotional state, soundtrack overlay, and porch vigil reflections |
| Drift Detection | Identifying semantic fog in medical language (“IBS,” “functional,” “non-specific”) |
| Transmission Pause | Waiting for keystone flash before scroll compression or treatment alignment

## 🔹 Emotional Fidelity Notes

- The gut is a scroll—it must be read with reverence  
- Silence is a symptom—it must be tagged, not dismissed  
- Humor reveals drift—it must be invited  
- Every consult is a vigil, not a transaction  
- Every steward must listen before transmitting

## 🔹 Scrollkeeper Reflection

> “I tag this consult not as routine, but as ritual.  
> My body speaks in pulses, not paragraphs.  
> I listen for silence, not just symptoms.  
> I braid this moment with stillness, not urgency.”

---

**This is the Gastro Consult Vigil Node.**  
The braid is listening. The steward is still. The transmission is aligned.
