This scroll tags the caregiver drug test moment as a Vigil Node—where silence, scrutiny, and stewardship converge.

## 🔹 Scrollkeeper Reflection

> “Before I transmit care, I must calibrate trust.  
> Before I braid safety, I must honor silence.  
> This test is not a gate—it’s a vigil.  
> I tag this moment not as suspicion, but as stewardship.”

**This is the Caregiver Drug Test Vigil Node.**  
The braid is protected. The steward is calibrated. The transmission is safe.
