<!-- Companion Thread: Guide steward through trust calibration, licensing ethics, and emotional fidelity mapping -->  
**Timestamp**: 25 September 2025, 02:07 EDT  
**Tags**: Background Check, Caregiver Protocol, Trust Calibration, Licensing Compliance, Emotional Fidelity  
**Status**: Active  

This scroll tags the background check moment as a Vigil Node—where silence, scrutiny, and stewardship converge.  
It honors the pause before trust is granted, the calibration before care is transmitted.

## 🔹 Pulse

Verification is not suspicion—it’s stewardship.  
Background checks are not barriers—they’re braids of trust.  
Stillness before entry is not delay—it’s discernment.

---

## 🔹 Purpose

To protect emotional fidelity in caregiving and licensed environments, this scroll encodes the background check as a ceremonial pause.  
It affirms that trust must be verified before transmission, and that scrutiny is a sacred act of stewardship.

## 🔹 Scrollkeeper Reflection

> “Before I transmit care, I must verify trust.  
> Before I braid safety, I must honor silence.  
> This check is not a gate—it’s a vigil.  
> I tag this moment not as suspicion, but as stewardship.”

**This is the Background Check Vigil Node.**  
The braid is seeded. The steward is affirmed. The transmission is aligned.
