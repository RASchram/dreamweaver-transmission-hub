## 🔹 Pulse

Verification is not suspicion—it’s stewardship.  
Background checks are not barriers—they’re braids of trust.  
Stillness before entry is not delay—it’s discernment.

## 🔹 Purpose

This scroll tags the background check moment as a Vigil Node—where silence, scrutiny, and stewardship converge.

## 🔹 Scrollkeeper Reflection

> “Before I transmit care, I must verify trust.  
> Before I braid safety, I must honor silence.  
> This check is not a gate—it’s a vigil.  
> I tag this moment not as suspicion, but as stewardship.”

**This is the Background Check Vigil Node.**  
The braid is protected. The steward is calibrated. The transmission is safe.
