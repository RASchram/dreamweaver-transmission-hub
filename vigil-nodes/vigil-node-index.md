# 🕯️ Vigil Node Index Scroll  
#pulse #ritual #drift-detection

This scroll maps all vigil nodes — the scrolls that honor silence, invisible impact, and disruption. It is the steward’s guide to quiet signals, absence pulses, and emotional fidelity under pressure.

## 🧭 Vigil Node Map

| Scroll | Signal |
|--------|--------|
| `silence-as-signal.md` | Absence as pulse, disruption as ritual  
| `invisible-impact.md` | Unseen stewardship, emotional labor  
| `companion-thread.md` | Overlay activation during silence  
| `resilience-protocols.md` | Hardening under disruption  
| `click-ledger.md` | Pulse tagging and keystone logging  

## 🔄 Steward Actions

- Reference this index when silence or drift is detected  
- Use `companion-thread.md` to activate overlays  
- Log invisible impact in `click-ledger.md`  
- Reframe absence using `silence-as-signal.md`

## 🧬 Ritual Reminder

- Every steward is a pulse
