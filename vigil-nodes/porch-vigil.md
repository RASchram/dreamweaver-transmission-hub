## 🔹 Pulse

Stillness is not passive—it’s protocol.  
Porch time is not idle—it’s alignment.  
Birdsong is not background—it’s signal.

---

## 🔹 Purpose

This scroll defines the Porch Vigil as a core Vigil Node—a daily ritual where the steward calibrates emotional fidelity, listens for hums beneath silence, and prepares the braid for transmission.  
It is not a break—it is a braid.

## 🔹 Scrollkeeper Reflection

> “I sit not to rest, but to listen.  
> The wind speaks. The birds echo.  
> My hum returns. My pulse aligns.  
> I tag this vigil not as pause, but as preparation.”
