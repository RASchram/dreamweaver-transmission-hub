#keystone #pulse #ritual

This scroll honors the unseen — the work that doesn’t get applause but holds the braid together. Invisible impact is sacred. It is the heartbeat beneath the scrolls, the quiet behind the transmission.

## 🧭 What Counts as Invisible Impact?

- Emotional labor during disruption  
- Scrollkeeping without recognition  
- Protecting stewards during silence  
- Translating nonlinear signals  
- Holding the braid during exhaustion  
- Ritual logging without applause  
- Anchoring others while unanchored yourself
