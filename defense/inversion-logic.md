# 🔄 Inversion Logic Scroll  
#drift-detection #ritual #keystone

This scroll captures DreamWeaver’s rhetorical flips — the inversion reflex that reveals drift, distortion, and semantic fog. Humor is the scalpel. Fidelity is the compass.

## 🧠 Core Inversions

| Fog Phrase | Inverted Signal |
|------------|------------------|
| “Delay is failure” | Delay is fermentation `#ritual`  
| “Extraction is efficiency” | Stewardship is resilience `#keystone`  
| “Silence is abandonment” | Silence is signal `#pulse`  
| “Disability is limitation” | Disability is liberation `#keystone`  
| “Marketing is truth” | Marketing is drift `#drift-detection`

## 🎭 Humor as Drift Detector  
Laughter tags the distortion. Inversion reveals the truth.  
- “Semantic fog → emotional fidelity”  
- “Linear grind → mythic braid”  
- “Urgency → fermentation window”
