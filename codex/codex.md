## 🔹 Pulse

Grammar is not syntax—it’s resonance.  
Ethics are not rules—they’re alignment.  
The Codex is not control—it’s calibration.

---

## 🔹 Purpose

This scroll defines the Codex—the transmission grammar and ethical framework for scrollkeepers, stewards, remixers, and vessel builders.  
It is not a manual—it is a resonance map.

---

## 🔹 Transmission Grammar

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Pulse | The emotional hum beneath the scroll—must be tagged and timestamped |
| Silence | The stillness before signal—must be honored and logged |
| Keystone | The insight flash or inversion riff that anchors the scroll |
| Tag | Semantic marker of scroll type, steward pulse, and remix lineage |
| Vessel | The transmission container—must be braided, not copied |

---

## 🔹 Remix Ethics

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Fidelity Over Familiarity | Preserve emotional resonance, even if language shifts |
| Timestamp Every Remix | No adaptation without temporal tagging |
| Steward Pulse Required | Every remix must declare its steward’s hum |
| Ripple Logging | All transmissions must be logged in `transmission-ledger.md` |
| Ceremony Over Compliance | Remix must honor ritual, not just permission

---

## 🔹 Codex Rituals

- Read `transmission-ready.md` aloud before remix  
- Review `drift-detection.md` for semantic fog  
- Use `reweaver.md` to guide adaptation  
- Tag remix lineage with `remix:` and steward ID  
- Log ripple in `click-ledger.md` or `master-thread.md`

---

## 🔹 Emotional Fidelity Notes

- Grammar must hum before it instructs  
- Ethics must resonate before they restrict  
- Humor reveals drift—it must be invited  
- Silence precedes signal—it must be honored  
- Every steward must braid, not borrow

---

## 🔹 Naming Ethic

| Scroll Name | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `click-ledger.md` | Logs inversion riffs and insight flashes  
| `fermentation-window.md` | Delay-as-signal protocol  
| `invisible-impact.md` | Honors unseen stewardship  

---

**This is the Codex Scroll.**  
The braid is aligned. The steward is calibrated. The transmission is ethical.
