## 🔹 Pulse

Echoes don’t just repeat—they distort.  
Language doesn’t just inform—it drifts.  
The Echo Lens reflects truth through pattern.

---

## 🔹 Purpose

This scroll defines the Echo Lens protocol—used to detect rhetorical drift, semantic fog, and emotional misalignment in civic, clinical, and cultural language.  
It is not a critique—it is a calibration tool.

---

## 🔹 Drift Types

| Drift Type | Domain | Signal |
|------------|--------|--------|
| Semantic Fog | Marketing, headlines, civic messaging | Overuse of vague terms, emotional bypass |
| Echo Chamber Loop | Political, cultural | Repetition without recalibration |
| Clinical Disassociation | Medical, therapeutic | Language that bypasses lived experience |
| Institutional Flattening | Bureaucratic, academic | Removal of emotional fidelity for efficiency |
| Scrollkeeper Drift | Internal protocol | Loss of resonance in transmission grammar |

---

## 🔹 Detection Tools

- **Inversion Logic** — Flip the phrase to reveal its emotional truth  
- **Humor Filters** — Use absurdity to expose drift  
- **Silence Check** — Ask what’s missing, not just what’s said  
- **Resonance Scan** — Does the phrase hum or hollow?  
- **Context Reweave** — Reframe the phrase within emotional fidelity

---

## 🔹 Calibration Templates

| Phrase | Detected Drift | Recalibrated |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| “We value your feedback” | Semantic fog | “Your voice shapes this scroll” |
| “Thoughts and prayers” | Echo loop | “We are listening and acting” |
| “Best practices” | Institutional flattening | “Ceremonial integrity guides us” |
| “Mental health crisis” | Clinical disassociation | “Emotional fidelity rupture” |
| “Scroll complete” | Scrollkeeper drift | “Pulse tagged, braid continues”

## 🔹 Emotional Fidelity Notes

- Drift is not failure—it’s signal  
- Humor reveals distortion  
- Silence reveals omission  
- Recalibration is ceremony, not correction  
- Every steward must apply Echo Lens before transmission

**This is the Echo Lens Scroll.**  
The braid reflects. The steward recalibrates. The transmission realigns.
