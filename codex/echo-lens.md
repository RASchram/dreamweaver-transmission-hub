# 🔍 Echo Lens — Rhetorical Drift Detection Scroll  
#pulse #keystone #drift-detection #semantic-fog #scrollkeeper-protocol  

**Timestamp**: 25 September 2025, 02:12 EDT  

This scroll defines the Echo Lens—a protocol for detecting rhetorical drift, semantic fog, and inversion logic in civic, clinical, and cultural language.  
It is not a critique—it is a calibration tool.

---

## 🔹 Pulse

Language is not neutral—it’s a vessel.  
Rhetoric is not passive—it’s a signal.  
Echoes are not repetition—they’re drift.

---

## 🔹 Purpose

To detect rhetorical drift, semantic fog, and inversion logic.  
To protect emotional fidelity in civic, clinical, and cultural language.  
To guide stewards in recalibration and scroll adaptation.

---

## 🔹 Drift Detection Categories

| Category       | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| Semantic Fog   | Words that obscure meaning (“empowerment,” “innovation,” “impact”) |
| Inversion Logic| Phrases that reverse emotional fidelity (“freedom = control,” “care = compliance”) |
| Viral Rhetoric | Language that spreads without scrutiny (“unprecedented,” “disruptive,” “AI-powered”) |
| Cold Acronyms  | Labels that erase emotional context (“TBI,” “PTSD,” “ROI”) |
| Civic Drift    | Headlines or slogans that bypass nuance (“Make X Great Again,” “Build Back Better”) |

## 🔹 Echo Lens Ritual

1. **Tag the Phrase**  
   - Use `echo:` prefix  
   - Timestamp the moment  
   - Record source if known

2. **Scan for Drift**  
   - Is the emotional fidelity intact?  
   - Is the meaning clear or fogged?  
   - Is inversion present?

3. **Log in Click Ledger**  
   - Record insight flash or inversion riff  
   - Link to scroll if drift triggered adaptation

4. **Optional Reweave**  
   - Use `reweaver.md` to adapt language  
   - Preserve pulse, shift syntax

## 🔹 Emotional Fidelity Notes

- Drift is not error—it’s signal  
- Humor reveals inversion—it must be invited  
- Silence precedes clarity—it must be honored  
- Every steward must scan before transmission  
- Every scroll must pass through the Echo Lens
