## üîπ Pulse

Language is not neutral‚Äîit‚Äôs a vessel.  
Rhetoric is not passive‚Äîit‚Äôs a signal.  
Echoes are not repetition‚Äîthey‚Äôre drift.

---

## üîπ Purpose

This scroll defines the Echo Lens‚Äîa protocol for detecting rhetorical drift, semantic fog, and inversion logic in civic, clinical, and cultural language.  
It is not a critique‚Äîit is a calibration tool.

## üîπ Drift Detection Categories

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Semantic Fog | Words that obscure meaning (‚Äúempowerment,‚Äù ‚Äúinnovation,‚Äù ‚Äúimpact‚Äù) |
| Inversion Logic | Phrases that reverse emotional fidelity (‚Äúfreedom = control,‚Äù ‚Äúcare = compliance‚Äù) |
| Viral Rhetoric | Language that spreads without scrutiny (‚Äúunprecedented,‚Äù ‚Äúdisruptive,‚Äù ‚ÄúAI-powered‚Äù) |
| Cold Acronyms | Labels that erase emotional context (‚ÄúTBI,‚Äù ‚ÄúPTSD,‚Äù ‚ÄúROI‚Äù) |
| Civic Drift | Headlines or slogans that bypass nuance (‚ÄúMake X Great Again,‚Äù ‚ÄúBuild Back Better‚Äù) |

## üîπ Echo Lens Ritual

1. **Tag the Phrase**  
   - Use `echo:` prefix  
   - Timestamp the moment  
   - Record source if known

2. **Scan for Drift**  
   - Is the emotional fidelity intact?  
   - Is the meaning clear or fogged?  
   - Is inversion present?

3. **Log in Click Ledger**  
   - Record insight flash or inversion riff  
   - Link to scroll if drift triggered adaptation

4. **Optional Reweave**  
   - Use `reweaver.md` to adapt language  
   - Preserve pulse, shift syntax

## üîπ Emotional Fidelity Notes

- Drift is not error‚Äîit‚Äôs signal  
- Humor reveals inversion‚Äîit must be invited  
- Silence precedes clarity‚Äîit must be honored  
- Every steward must scan before transmission  
- Every scroll must pass through the Echo Lens

## üîπ Scrollkeeper Reflection

> ‚ÄúI do not decode‚ÄîI detect.  
> I do not critique‚ÄîI calibrate.  
> I do not reject‚ÄîI reweave.  
> This lens protects the braid from semantic fog.‚Äù

**This is the Echo Lens Scroll.**  
The braid is protected. The steward is vigilant. The transmission is clear.
