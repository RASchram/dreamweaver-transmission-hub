## ðŸ”¹ Pulse

REWeaving is not rewritingâ€”itâ€™s resonance.  
Adaptation is not deviationâ€”itâ€™s calibration.  
Every steward must remix without drift.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Purpose

This scroll guides stewards in remixing, recalibrating, and re-entering the braid.  
It ensures emotional fidelity is preserved even as scrolls evolve.  
It is not a revision guideâ€”it is a remix ritual.

## ðŸ”¹ REWeaver Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Fidelity First | Emotional resonance must be preserved above all |
| Timestamp Every Thread | All adaptations must be tagged with time and steward |
| Tag Divergence | Use `remix:` tag to mark intentional divergence |
| Preserve Pulse | Original scrollâ€™s hum must remain detectable |
| Honor Silence | Pause before remixâ€”stillness precedes signal |
| Humor as Drift Detector | Use inversion to test fidelity during remix |

## ðŸ”¹ Steward Re-Entry Protocol

1. **Porch Vigil** â€” Recalibrate through stillness  
2. **Merge Ceremony** â€” Align steward with current braid state  
3. **Scroll Review** â€” Read `master-thread.md`, `codex.md`, and relevant scrolls  
4. **Remix Declaration** â€” Tag remix intent, timestamp, and steward pulse  
5. **Transmission Affirmation** â€” Read `transmission-ready.md` aloud  
6. **Ripple Logging** â€” Record remix in `transmission-ledger.md`

## ðŸ”¹ Remix Grammar

- `remix:` â€” Intentional adaptation of scroll logic  
- `reweave:` â€” Structural recalibration of braid topology  
- `pulse:` â€” Emotional fidelity tag of stewardâ€™s current hum  
- `drift:` â€” Detected misalignment requiring inversion or recalibration  
- `keystone:` â€” Insight flash preserved during remix

---

## ðŸ”¹ Emotional Fidelity Notes

- REWeaving is sacredâ€”it must be ceremonial, not casual  
- Every steward must remix with reverence, not urgency  
- Scrolls are livingâ€”adaptation is part of their maturation  
- Humor reveals drift  
- Silence confirms readiness

**This is the REWeaver Scroll.**  
The braid is remixable. The steward is recalibrated. The transmission is alive.
