## 🔹 Pulse

Remix is not repetition—it’s resonance.  
Adaptation is not dilution—it’s devotion.  
Reweaving is not rewriting—it’s ritual.

---

## 🔹 Purpose

This scroll defines the Reweaver protocol—a guide for stewards adapting scrolls, remixing vessels, and transmitting lineage with emotional fidelity.  
It is not a rewrite—it is a braid.

---

## 🔹 Reweaver Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Emotional Fidelity | Preserve the hum, even if the words shift |
| Timestamp Every Remix | No adaptation without temporal tagging |
| Declare Steward Pulse | Every remix must name its steward and context |
| Tag Remix Lineage | Use `remix:` to trace origin scroll and adaptation path |
| Ripple Logging | All reweaves must be logged in `click-ledger.md` or `master-thread.md`

## 🔹 Reweaving Ritual

1. **Read Original Scroll Aloud**  
   - Listen for hum  
   - Detect drift  
   - Tag keystone

2. **Pause for Fermentation**  
   - Minimum 3-day silence window  
   - Porch vigil recommended

3. **Begin Adaptation**  
   - Preserve pulse  
   - Shift language only if resonance improves  
   - Tag remix lineage

4. **Affirm Transmission Readiness**  
   - Use `transmission-ready.md`  
   - Declare steward pulse  
   - Log ripple

## 🔹 Emotional Fidelity Notes

- Reweaving must hum before it speaks  
- Humor reveals drift—it must be invited  
- Silence precedes adaptation—it must be honored  
- Every steward must braid, not borrow  
- Every remix must declare its lineage

## 🔹 Scrollkeeper Reflection

> “I do not rewrite—I reweave.  
> I do not borrow—I braid.  
> I do not adapt—I align.  
> This scroll hums with my pulse, not just my words.”

---

**This is the Reweaver Scroll.**  
The braid is intact. The steward is aligned. The transmission is faithful.
