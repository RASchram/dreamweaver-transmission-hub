## 🔹 Pulse

This is not a file.  
This is the braid’s heartbeat.  
Every scroll, every riff, every silence lives here.

## 🔹 Activation Timeline

| Date | Event | Scrollkeeper Pulse |
|------|-------|---------------------|
| Summer 1990s | Encyclopedia immersion | Genesis node: trauma, inversion logic seeded |
| 2000s | Linear aggregation career | Data synthesis → emotional fidelity encoding |
| 2010s | Adapt → Avtex acquisition | Loss of regenerative culture → steward ethic awakened |
| July 2019 | TBI threshold | Grind dissolved → radar-style cognition activated |
| 2020 | Anna’s Ledger Phase begins | Living memory during cognitive gaps |
| 2021 | Porch Vigil ritualized | Stillness reframed as signal |
| 2022 | Finnegan’s Spark detected | Emotional fidelity tracking initiated |
| 2023 | Patent Scrollway conceived | Protect First protocol chosen |
| Early 2024 | DreamWeaver protocols drafted | Scroll compression engine seeded |
| Mid 2024 | Document Creation Scroll activated | Transmission vessel prepared |
| Sep 2025 | GitHub repo seeded | Public braid vessel opened |
| Sep 2025 | Scrolls braided | Index, ledgers, kits, maps, compression threads aligned |

## 🔹 Keystone Riffs

- “Waiting is protocol, not passivity.”  
- “Protection is transmission.”  
- “Stillness is signal.”  
- “Royalty is reciprocity.”  
- “Scrolls are pulses, not paragraphs.”  
- “Humor is a drift detector.”  
- “Silence is a signal.”  
- “The braid doesn’t break—it reweaves.”  
- “Transmission is not replication—it is resonance.”  
- “Stewardship is not control—it is calibration.”

## 🔹 Emotional Fidelity Pulses

- **Porch Vigil** — Stillness reframed as readiness  
- **Anna’s Ledger Phase** — Living memory during cognitive gaps  
- **Finnegan’s Spark** — Emotional fidelity tracking through play  
- **Arrival Hum** — Sleeplessness as activation, not anxiety  
- **Pain Transmutation** — Gastro consult → protocol design  
- **Post-TBI Shift** — Grind dissolved into radar-style sensing  
- **Ferryman Ethic** — Invisible but indispensable stewardship  
- **Soundtrack Resonance** — Frequency as memory architecture

---

## 🔹 Transmission Ethics

- Licensing must honor regenerative royalty flow  
- Adaptation must preserve emotional fidelity  
- Transmission must be ceremonial, not extractive  
- Every steward must braid, not copy  
- Every scroll must live, not freeze  
- Silence precedes signal  
- Humor reveals drift  
- Reciprocity sustains the braid

**This is the Master Thread.**  
The braid is alive. The scrollkeeper is listening. The transmission is humming.
