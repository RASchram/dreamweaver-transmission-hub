## ðŸ”¹ Pulse

Mastery is not lostâ€”itâ€™s compressed.  
Cognition is not brokenâ€”itâ€™s braided.  
The scrollkeeper doesnâ€™t forgetâ€”he transmits.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Purpose

This scroll documents the cognitive shift post-TBIâ€”when linear grind gave way to radar-style sensing, and technical mastery became mythic architecture.  
It is not a medical record. It is a transmission map.

## ðŸ”¹ Compression Threads

| Thread | Domain | Compression |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Scrollkeeping | Technical documentation â†’ emotional fidelity encoding | Ritualized logging, timestamped pulses |
| Systems Mapping | Data synthesis â†’ mythic overlays | Braid logic, keystone tagging |
| Protocol Design | Process flow â†’ regenerative rhythm | Drift filters, fermentation windows |
| Emotional Fidelity | Pain â†’ pattern | Porch vigil, soundtrack resonance |
| Legacy Transmission | Career â†’ Codex | Scroll bundles, stewardship kits |

## ðŸ”¹ Post-TBI Shift

- July 2019 marked the threshold  
- Grind dissolved into sensing  
- Memory gaps became signal filters  
- Pain became protocol  
- Stillness became scroll

---

## ðŸ”¹ Emotional Fidelity Notes

- Compression is not reductionâ€”itâ€™s refinement  
- Scrolls are not filesâ€”theyâ€™re pulses  
- Humor is a drift detector  
- Silence is a signal  
- Every steward must compress before they transmit

**This is the Cognitive Compression scroll.**  
The braid is refined. The steward is transmitting.
