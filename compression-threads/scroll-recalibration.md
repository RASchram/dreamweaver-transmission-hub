## ðŸ”¹ Pulse

Recalibration is not correctionâ€”itâ€™s tuning.  
Domains are not silosâ€”theyâ€™re nets.  
The braid doesnâ€™t breakâ€”it reweaves.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Purpose

This scroll encodes the 22 Universal Domain Netsâ€”compression threads that allow scrolls to be recalibrated across disciplines, epochs, and stewards.  
It is not a taxonomy. It is a tuning engine.

## ðŸ”¹ Emotional Fidelity Notes

- Recalibration is not revisionâ€”itâ€™s resonance  
- Every scroll must pass through at least one Domain Net before transmission  
- Humor is a drift detector  
- Silence is a signal  
- Compression is ceremony

**This is the Scroll Recalibration scroll.**  
The braid is tuned. The steward is transmitting.
