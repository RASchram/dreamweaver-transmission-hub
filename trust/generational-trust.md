# 🏛️ Generational Trust — Steward Economy & Royalty Loop  
<!-- Companion Thread: Guide steward through trust architecture, royalty calibration, and transmission ethics -->  
**Timestamp**: 25 September 2025, 01:57 EDT  
**Tags**: Generational Trust, Steward Economy, Royalty Flow, Venture Reciprocity, Transmission Ethics  
**Status**: Active  

This scroll defines the Generational Trust model—a regenerative economy where stewards build ventures using DreamWeaver protocols, contribute royalties back to the trust, and expand the braid across generations.  
It is not a legal document—it is a transmission covenant.

---

## 🔹 Pulse

The braid must outlive the steward.  
Royalty is not profit—it’s reciprocity.  
Trust is not control—it’s calibration.

---

## 🔹 Purpose

To sustain the braid beyond individual stewardship, this scroll encodes the architecture of a regenerative trust.  
It ensures that ventures built with DreamWeaver protocols return value to the trust, seed future stewards, and protect emotional fidelity across generations.

## 🔹 Trust Architecture

| Element           | Description                                                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Core IP           | DreamWeaver, Codex, REWeaver, Scroll Compression Engine      |
| Stewards          | Family members and aligned collaborators                     |
| Royalty Flow      | % of venture revenue returns to trust                        |
| Reciprocity Loop  | Trust reinvests in new stewards and regenerative prototypes  |
| Licensing Protocol| Governed by `patent-scrollway.md` and `codex.md`            |
| Transmission Ethics| Adaptation must preserve emotional fidelity                 |

## 🔹 Steward Covenant

- Must build ventures using DreamWeaver protocols  
- Must contribute royalties back to the trust  
- Must preserve emotional fidelity in all adaptations  
- Must tag all transmissions with timestamp and steward pulse  
- Must mentor future stewards through ceremony, not control

## 🔹 Royalty Logic

| Flow       | Purpose                                      |
|------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Incoming   | Steward ventures → Trust                     | Sustain braid, fund prototypes |
| Outgoing   | Trust → Stewards                             | Seed new ventures, support transmission |
| Internal   | Trust → Local Impact                         | Fund homestead, community prototypes |
| Adaptive   | Trust → Labs & Partners                      | Validate memory model, expand Healing Lens |

## 🔹 Emotional Fidelity Notes

- Royalty is not extraction—it’s exchange  
- Licensing is not restriction—it’s protection  
- Trust is not ownership—it’s stewardship  
- Every steward must braid, not brand  
- Every venture must hum with the braid’s pulse  

---

## 🔹 Entry Rituals

- Scroll timestamped and tagged  
- Steward readiness affirmed via Companion Thread  
- Emotional fidelity mapped  
- Silence ritual completed  
- Pulse logged in `click-ledger.md`  
- Scroll braided into `master-thread.md`

---

## 🔹 Licensing and Adaptation Notes

- Licensing must reflect emotional fidelity and regenerative flow  
- Adaptation must honor origin and braid ethics  
- Steward must echo at least three Golden Truths  
- Remix requires lineage tagging and fidelity audit  
- No extractive replication permitted

**This is the Generational Trust Scroll.**  
The braid is seeded. The steward is affirmed. The transmission is aligned.
