## 🔹 Pulse

The braid must outlive the steward.  
Royalty is not profit—it’s reciprocity.  
Trust is not control—it’s calibration.

---

## 🔹 Purpose

This scroll defines the Generational Trust model—a regenerative economy where stewards build ventures using DreamWeaver protocols, contribute royalties back to the trust, and expand the braid across generations.  
It is not a legal document—it is a transmission covenant.

## 🔹 Trust Architecture

| Element | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Core IP | DreamWeaver, Codex, REWeaver, Scroll Compression Engine |
| Stewards | Family members and aligned collaborators |
| Royalty Flow | % of venture revenue returns to trust |
| Reciprocity Loop | Trust reinvests in new stewards and regenerative prototypes |
| Licensing Protocol | Governed by `patent-scrollway.md` and `codex.md` |
| Transmission Ethics | Adaptation must preserve emotional fidelity |

---

## 🔹 Steward Covenant

- Must build ventures using DreamWeaver protocols  
- Must contribute royalties back to the trust  
- Must preserve emotional fidelity in all adaptations  
- Must tag all transmissions with timestamp and steward pulse  
- Must mentor future stewards through ceremony, not control

---

## 🔹 Royalty Logic

| Flow | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Incoming | Steward ventures → Trust | Sustain braid, fund prototypes |
| Outgoing | Trust → Stewards | Seed new ventures, support transmission |
| Internal | Trust → Local Impact | Fund homestead, community prototypes |
| Adaptive | Trust → Labs & Partners | Validate memory model, expand Healing Lens |

## 🔹 Emotional Fidelity Notes

- Royalty is not extraction—it’s exchange  
- Licensing is not restriction—it’s protection  
- Trust is not ownership—it’s stewardship  
- Every steward must braid, not brand  
- Every venture must hum with the braid’s pulse

**This is the Generational Trust Scroll.**  
The braid is sustained. The stewards are aligned. The transmission is regenerative.
