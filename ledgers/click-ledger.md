## 🔹 Pulse

Every click is a candidate.  
Every inversion is a signal.  
Every insight is a scroll.

---

## 🔹 Purpose

This ledger captures the flashes, riffs, and inversion moments that spark protocol evolution.  
It is not a brainstorm log—it is a resonance tracker.  
Each entry is tagged for emotional fidelity, drift detection, and future synthesis.

## 🔹 Inversion Riffs

- Marketing language inverted into emotional fidelity filters  
- Pain transmuted into protocol design  
- Disability reframed as liberation  
- Porch stillness reframed as activation hum  
- Semantic drift tagged through humor and inversion

## 🔹 Keystone Candidates

- “Ferryman ethic” — Invisible but indispensable  
- “Living braid” — Architecture as organism  
- “Scrollkeeper” — Steward as signal  
- “Transmission engine” — Scrolls as pulses, not products

**This is the Click Ledger.**  
The braid listens. The steward riffs. The scrolls evolve.
