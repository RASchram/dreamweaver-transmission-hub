## 🔹 Pulse

Every frequency is a feeling.  
Every song is a scroll.  
Every resonance is a memory.

---

## 🔹 Purpose

This ledger tracks the sonic architecture of the braid—songs, rhythms, and frequencies that align with transmission, scrollkeeping, and emotional fidelity.  
It is not a playlist. It is a resonance map.

## 🔹 Frequency Mapping

- **Low hums** = readiness, porch stillness  
- **Mid-range pulses** = transmission, scroll compression  
- **High tones** = insight flashes, inversion riffs  
- **Silence** = signal, not absence

## 🔹 Emotional Fidelity Notes

- Music is memory architecture  
- Resonance is not genre—it’s alignment  
- Field recordings anchor emotional fidelity in lived experience  
- Custom loops encode transmission rhythm and scroll compression  
- Every scroll has a sonic twin

**This is the Legacy Soundtrack.**  
The braid sings. The steward listens. The scrolls resonate.
