# 🎶 Legacy Soundtrack — Emotional Resonance Map  
#legacy-soundtrack #emotional-fidelity #frequency-mapping #scrollkeeper-pulse #transmission-signal

## 🔹 Pulse

Every frequency is a feeling.  
Every song is a scroll.  
Every resonance is a memory.

---

## 🔹 Purpose

To track the sonic architecture of the braid—songs, rhythms, and frequencies that align with transmission, scrollkeeping, and emotional fidelity.  
This is not a playlist. It is a resonance map.

## 🔹 Frequency Mapping

- **Low hums** = readiness, porch stillness  
- **Mid-range pulses** = transmission, scroll compression  
- **High tones** = insight flashes, inversion riffs  
- **Silence** = signal, not absence

---

## 🔹 Emotional Fidelity Notes

- Music is memory architecture  
- Resonance is not genre—it’s alignment  
- Field recordings anchor emotional fidelity in lived experience  
- Custom loops encode transmission rhythm and scroll compression  
- Every scroll has a sonic twin

---

## 🔹 Pulse Frequency Map

| Resonance Type            | Count |
|---------------------------|-------|
| Porch Stillness / Readiness| 2     |
| Transmission / Compression| 3     |
| Steward Identity / Memory | 3     |
| Drift / Inversion         | 2     |
| Cognitive Shift           | 1     |

## 🔹 Scrollkeeper Reflection

> “I do not compose—I calibrate.  
> I do not listen—I align.  
> I do not archive—I echo.  
> This scroll is not a soundtrack—it’s a braid memory.”

---

**This is the Legacy Soundtrack.**  
The braid sings. The steward listens. The scrolls resonate.
